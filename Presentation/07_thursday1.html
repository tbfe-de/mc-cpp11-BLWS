template: plain
name: cpp_iostreams_recap
header: ## I/O-Streams (Recap)

The overall design of C++ I/O-streams is founded on seven classes further
explained on the next slides.

.N[
Actually these classes are only type definitions of some more basic templates
that parametrize various aspects like the character type and traits of the
streams.
]

For readability and as is sufficient to gain a basic understanding of the
architecture, the following treats

* `std::ios`, `std::istream` … etc. … to `std::ostringstream`

instantiating the basic templates (`std::basic_ios` etc.) for plain characters
as if they were the classes in question, not just type definitions which are
similarly provided for wide characters:
 
* `std::wios`, `std::wistream` … etc. … to `std::wostringstream`

---
template: plain
name: ios_base_class
header: ### Class `std::ios`

This is the base class._[] of

* [`std::istream`](#istream_base_class) and

* [`std::ostream`](#ostream_base_class)

centralizing a number of

* type definitions – like for the underlying character type (`ios::char_type`)
  or [seeking in stream](#stream_seeking),

* enumerations – like `ios::fmtflags` for global formatting flags (`ios::fixed`,
  `ios::scientific`, …) or the [stream states](#stream_states), and

* common member data and functions – like for accessing and modifying formatting
  options (`std::ios::flags`, `std::ios::fill`, …) or whether state changes
  should be notified by throwing [stream exceptions](#stream_exceptions).

.F[:
For technical reasons a part of what is listed here is actually defined in an
`std:ios` base class `std::ios_base`. To get a basic understanding for the C++
I/O-stream design this is a detail that need not be further explored.
]

---
template: plain
name: istream_base_class
header: ### Class `std::istream`

This class is derived from [`std::ios`](#ios_base_class) with the main purpose
to pool the *stream extraction operations* (aka. input), e.g. read._[]

* single characters (`get` with various overloads),

* lines of text into an `std::string` (`getline`),

* blocks of given length (`read`, `readsome`), or

* formatted input (`operator>>` for type specific conversion from text).

.F[:
Not everything named below is a member – there are also global functions with an
`std::istream` argument or overloads for `operator>>` with a left-hand-side
operand of type `std::istream`.
]

.N[
Whenever some function is **parametrized on a stream input source**
`std::istream&` is usually the best choice for the argument type.
]

Choosing `std::ifstream` or `std::istringstream` instead would limit the
selection of possible input sources at the callers side.

---
template: plain
name: ostream_base_class
header: ### Class `std::ostream`

This class is derived from [`std::ios`](#ios_base_class) with the main purpose
to pool the *stream insertion operations* (aka. output), e.g. write

* single characters (`put` with various overloads),._[]

* blocks of given length (`write`, `writesome`), or

* formatted output (`operator<<` for type specific conversion to text).

.F[:
There is no `putline` counterpart to `getline` but `operator<<` is (of course)
defined and fully sufficient for output of `std::string`-s.
]

.N[
Whenever some function is **parametrized on a stream output sink**
`std::ostream&` is usually the best choice for the argument type.
]

Choosing `std::ofstream` or `std::ostringstream` instead would limit the
selection of possible output sinks at the callers side.

---
template: plain
name: filestream_classes
header: ### File-Stream Classes

The file stream classes (accessible via the header `<fstream>`)

* `std::ifstream` and

* `std::ofstream`

are in turn derived from the base `std::ios`.

.N[
Via an appropriate [stream buffer](#buffer_interface) an instance of any of
these classes connects to a classic file as sink or source for the actual input
and output.
]

Besides files residing as data container in some (non-volatile) storage space,
the term *classic file* here includes also abstractions like stream sockets.._[]

.F[:
Or even more generally in Unix/Linux: everything that has an entry in the file
system (`/dev/…`, `/sys/…`, `/proc/…`), i.e. serial or parallel ports, raw
disks, information on processes, connected peripherals …).
]

---
template: plain
name: stringstream_classes
header: ### String-Stream Classes

The string stream classes (accessible via the header `<sstream>`._[])

* `std::istringstream` and

* `std::ostringstream`

are in turn derived from the base `std::ios`.

.F[:
Note that the header discussed here is spelled `<sstream>`, not `<stringstream>`
and not `<strstream>`. In fact, the latter is the name of an earlier, similar
interface (based on character arrays instead of `std::string`s) which is
deprecated since C++98.
]

.N[
Via an appropriate [stream buffer](#buffer_interface) an instance of any of
these classes can connect to an `std::string` as sink or source for the actual
input and output.
]

In case of `std::ostringstream` space for the character sequence stored is
allocated dynamically – and fully transparent to the client.

Generally the amount of data to be stored in a string stream is only limited by
the main memory available to a process and may be even more as physically
installed RAM …

---
template: plain
name: stringstream_classes
header: ### Readable, Writeable, and Read-Writeable Streams

The previous slides concentrated on streams with a specific purpose:

* `std::ifstream` and `std::istringstream` as data source

* `std::ofstream` and `std::ostringstream` as data sink

There is also the combination, i.e.

* `std::fstream` allowing input and output to the same file, and

* `std::stringstream` allowing input and output to the same `std::string`.

If there is only one direction into which the data moves, these need not be used
and should be second choice.

.W[
Otherwise you need to understand the underlying buffer management to guide your
decisions if the buffer needs to be flushed when switching between input and
output.
]

---
template: plain
name: stream_seeking
header: ### Seeking in Streams

At the heart of the I/O-stream model are the *seek positions*, working much like
an "invisible marker" just before the character that is next to be processed (on
input) or overwritten (on output).

These are independently managed for input and output and also called:

* *get position* 
  accessed with `tellg` and eventually modified with `seekg`;

* *put position*
  accessed with `tellp` and eventually modified with `seekp`.

The positions are measured in *characters*._[] relative to the begin of the file
by `tellg` and `tellp`, and can be set with `seekg` and `seekp` in three ways:

* relative to the begin of the file,

* relative to the (current) end of the file, or

* relative to the current position.

.F[:
The actual character type will of course be `wchar_t` for the wide streams
(`wistream`, `wostream`, etc.) but it needs to be understood that these are not
necessarily the *"user perceived characters"*, nor need there be a 1:1
correspondence to *"code points"* of a character set as UTF-32, as both –
UTF-8 (based on 8 bit units) and UTF-16 (based on 16 bit units) – use a variable
length encoding scheme.
]

---
template: plain
name: stream_states
header: ### Stream States

An input or output stream can generally switch between a number of states:

Technically these are not mutually exclusive (as the term "state" might suggest)
but there are just three flags that may be set independently:

* `std::ios::eofbit` – testable with the member function `eof()`  
  set when the stream has advanced over its last character;._[]

* `std::ios::failbit` – testable with the member function `fail()`
  some *"soft error"* has occurred and a retry may make sense;

* `std::ios::badbit` – testable with the member function `bad()`
  some *"hard error"* has occurred (it's unlikely a retry will recover).

.F[:
Testing this state makes sense mostly for data sources but in case of a data
sink it may be set too if there is no more room on the device where the output
is to be stored, though due to buffered output it can rather be expected that
the stream enters the fail state when the buffer is written.
]

.N[
When none of the above flags is set the stream is said to be in *good* state –
testable with the member function `good()`.
]

---
template: plain
name: implicit_state_switch
header: #### Implicit Stream State Switching

For one, stream states may be switched during I/O taking place, according to the
following rules:

* When stream extraction has moved over the last character – the physical end of
  the file for an external file or the last character on an `std::string`- the
  `std::ios::eofbit` flag will be set.

* When there is a problem converting the characters read while processing
  formatted input the `std::ios::failbit` flag will be set.

* When there is any other severe problem the `std::ios::badbit` flag will be
  set.

.N[
Once any of the above flags is set, the stream will temporarily cease to be
usable for nearly most any operation.
]

---
template: plain
name: explicit_state_switch
header: #### Explicit Stream State Switching

The only operations carried out while a stream is not in the
[good state](#stream_states) are:

* `clear()` – clear all state flags;._[]

* `close()` – release connection to data sink or source.

.F[:
Any argument specified **will set(!!) the flags** named by it, so
`strm.clear(std::ios::fail)` may be part of the implementation of `operator>>`
for a user type to indicate a formatting error.
]

Note that clearing the state flags does what it says: the state flags will be
cleared, nothing less, nothing more.

**Especially the [get position](#stream_seeking) will not change.**

If the root of the problem was a formatting error – e.g. it was tried to read an
`int` while the next input character was a non-digit – that character must be
skipped somehow.

.W[
It is a common error of novices to either forget the above or to overlook the
fact that all the error flags need to be cleared **before** advancing the get
position.
]

---
template: plain
name: stream_exceptions
header: ### Stream Exceptions

Optionally an exception may be thrown when a stream sets any of its state
flags._[]

.F[:
The stream interface with its implicit and explicit state switching was defined
in a time when C++ not yet had exceptions. For backward compatibility the
default behavior is still to ignore I/O operations for streams that are not in
the *good state*. For new software developments this makes less sense as it
delays the impact of problems and therefore impedes error analysis.
]

Individually for

* each stream instance and

* each [state flag](#stream_states)

it can be chosen that an exception is thrown whenever the state bit is set.

.N[
In addition this causes an exception to be thrown by any stream operation that
would otherwise be silently ignored (outside the *good* state).
]

---
template: plain
name: stream_exception_example
header: #### Stream Exceptions Example

Read `float` values from standard input and calculate sum:._[]
```
cin.exceptions(std::ios::failbit | std::ios::badbit);
double sum{0.0};
bool giveup{false};
do {
    try {
        double val;
        while (cin >> val)
            sum += val;
    }
    catch (std::ios_base::failure &e) {
        if (cin.bad()) {
            giveup = true;
            cerr << "giving up before eof is reached" << endl;
        }
        else if (!cin.eof()) {
            cin.clear();
            cerr << "char ignored: " << char(cin.get()) << endl;
        }
    }
} while (!cin.eof() && !giveup);
```

.F[:
Necessary includes and namespace directives assumed.
]

---
template: plain
name: buffer_interface
header: ## The Buffer Interface

One of the main purposes of the stream classes is to make input and output
efficient, especially if the actual source or sink is a classic file:

* Accessing the external store will usually happen in large chunks …

* … while the program logic can deal with the stream content in whatever
  portions are convenient.

.N[
Usually buffering and the logic involved is to the most part transparent to a
client (program) using C++ I/O-streams.
]

But there is also the option to take over control by implementing new buffer
classes for a specific purpose.._[] Applied wisely, this approach

* can lead to a hight degree of encapsulation
 
* and may also promote the potential for reuse.

.F[:
Such may als be derived from `std::filebuf` or `std::stringbuf` if refined file
streams or string streams are necessary.
]

---
template: plain
name: input_stream_buffers
header: ## Buffers for Input Streams

The minimum requirement for implementing a buffer to be used with a special kind
of input stream is to

* implement the member function `underflow`,

* which will be called whenever (more) input needs to be retrieved from the
  physical source.

Especially there are no other member functions necessary, though such may help
to improve performance.

Actually the above also assumes the default – that is not to do any input
buffering but forward each character immediately – though setting up a real
input buffer is straight forward and not so much of an effort.._[]

.F[:
Assuming a base class is used that takes care of the nitty-gritty details, like
mandatory type definitions and default implementations for optional member
functions.
]

.I[
Implementing **input buffers as reusable components** is particularly easy with
[Boost.Iostreams](#boost_iostreams).
]

---
template: plain
name: output_stream_buffers
header: ## Buffers for Output Streams

The minimum requirement for implementing a buffer to be used with a special kind
of output stream is to

* implement the member function `overflow`,

* which will be called whenever there is no more room to buffer the output
  destined for the physical sink.

Especially there are no other member functions necessary, though such may help
to improve performance.

Actually the above also assumes the default – that is not to do any output
buffering but forward each character immediately – though setting up a real
output buffer is usually straight forward and not so much of an effort.._[]

.I[
Implementing **output buffers as reusable components** is particularly easy with
[Boost.Iostreams](#boost_iostreams).
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: iostreams/doc/index
name: boost_iostreams
header: ## Boost: Iostreams

[Boost.Iostream]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/iostreams/doc/index.html

[Boost.Iostream] is particularly helpful to implement

* specialized stream buffers for input and output as reusable components

* which may be dynamically configured depending on what is needed.

.N[
To some degree the approach is similar to pipelining some input for or output of
an application through standard programs.
]

The only difference is that everything happens internally, but the idea of
combining small modules of which

* each *does a single, simple thing* well

is exactly the same.._[]

.F[:
If all what has to be done can be expressed with input and output modules only,
Boost.Iostream even contains a small helper that can replace a main program,
feeding the input from one stream as output to the other one.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: iostreams/doc/index
name: boost_iostreams_preprocessing
header: ### Input Preprocessing

As an example may serve an idea for components which help to parse Unix-style
configuration files.._[]

.F[:
Configuration file syntax in Unix was (and still is in Linux) often "ad hoc" but
some common style has emerged over time: (1) empty line are not significant, (2)
comments can be embedded in lines starting with a hash-sign ('#'), and (3) long
lines maybe broken into parts by ending lines that continue with a backslash
('\').
]

There could be

* one module to strip empty lines and comments and

* another module to join continuation lines,

both of which are near to trivial and hence easy to develop and test.

* An independent example were a module that recognizes and appropriately replace
  XML character encodings (like '&*xx*;').

.N[
In any case, from the viewpoint of the actual application just plain text is
read from an input stream.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: iostreams/doc/index
name: boost_iostreams_postprocessing
header: ### Output Postprocessing

As examples may serve components caring for some normalization in a
postprocessing step, that may be dynamically configured from a library with
reusable components.

* Recognize and appropriately replace non-ASCII characters with the equivalent
  XML encoding (i.e. '&*xx*;').._[]

* Format simple plain text by breaking long lines at white space if a certain
  line length would otherwise be exceeded.

* As before but automatically insert a line continuation convention (like ending
  lines to be continue with a backslash).

* Prefix each line with its line number.

.F[:
As the mechanism is generic to stream buffers, such modules may also be applied
in a way that the output is caught in a string, so that – with the same module –
only plain text parts of a web page could be sanitized by replacing '<' with
'&lt;' etc. but not for the actual HTML tags.
]

.N[
In any case, from the viewpoint of the actual application just plain text is
written to an output stream.
]

template: refersto

name: boost_serialization
header: ## Boost: Serialization

[Boost.Serialization]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/serialization/doc/index.html

With [Boost.Serialization] object instances may be saved to persistent storage
at some point to be restored later.

.N[
This includes instances referring to each other via pointers or references:  
The mechanism takes care for "duplicates" if in a network of objects a
particular instance is reachable via more than one path.
]

The obvious applications are:

* Save the last state to continue the next run of an application where the
  previous left off.

* Checkpoint an application to provide a roll-back facility via the snapshots
  taken, or reconstruct history.

The degree to which this can work non-intrusive is limited, especially compared
to other languages with much richer support for introspection.._[]

.F[:
E.g. Java has a *reflection interface* that is close to perfect … but on the
other hand requires a lot of meta-information to be stored – even if a program
never makes use of serialization.

Concurrency features in C++11 may appear "as just some more library classes and
functions", but especially in the area of allowed optimisations and how to
provide [Cache Coherence] on modern multi-core CPUs, it is also closely
intertwined with code generation.  For more information see:

template: plain
name: parallelizing_tasks
header: ### Parallelizing Independent Tasks

For complex tasks that can be split into independent parts, concurrency **and
scalability to multiple cores** can be easily achieved by following a simple
recipe:

1. Separate the task into a number of different functions (or calls of the same
   function with different arguments).
2. Run each such function by handing it over to `std::async`, storing the
  `future` that is returned (easiest in an `auto`-typed variable).
3. Fetch (and combine) the results by calling the member function `get` for
   each `future`.

That way all the functions may run concurrently and the last step synchronizes
by waiting for completion.

.I[
For more information on parallelizing independent task that way see:
http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/async
]

.F[:
Technically the return value of `std::async` is an `std::future` but as this
is a template and the type is usually somewhat different to spell out, most
usages of `std::async` store the result in an `auto`-typed variable.
]

---
template: plain
name: futures_and_promises
header: #### Foundation: Futures and Promises

The foundation on which parallelizing tasks is build are [Futures and Promises].

These need not be fully understood to apply the API (exemplified on the next
pages), but may help to understand the basic machinery:

* A future is the concrete handle which a client can use to fetch the result,
  presumably made available by a different thread of execution.

* A promise is a helper class which may be used in a separate thread to make
  a result available for a client.

.I[
For more information on promises and futures see:
http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/future
http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/promise
http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/packaged_task
]

[Futures and Promises]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises

---
template: plain
name: parallelizing_example
header: #### Parallelizing Example

The following example calculates the sum of the first `N` elements in `data`
by splitting the work of `std::accumulate`, into two separate function calls,
that may run concurrently:._[]
```
// calculate sum of first N values in data
//
long long sum(const int data[], std::size_t N) {
    auto lower_part_sum = std::async(
        [=]{ return std::accumulate(&data[0], &data[N/2], 0LL); }
    );
    auto upper_part_sum = std::async(
        [=]{ return std::accumulate(&data[N/2], &data[N], 0LL); }
    );
    return lower_part_sum.get()
         + upper_part_sum.get();
}
```

.F[:
Note the use of lambdas above – the actual call to `std::accumulate` will only
happen when the lambda gets executed! A similar effect can be achieved as
follows:
```
  // preparing the callable for std::async with std::bind:
… std::async(std::bind(std::accumulate, &data[0], &data[N/2], 0LL)) …
… std::async(std::bind(std::accumulate, &data[N/2], &data[N], 0LL)) …
```
]

---
template: plain
header: #### Default Launch Policy

The default behavior is that the systems decides on its own whether an
asynchronously started task is run concurrently.._[]

Using `std::async` **without an explicit launch policy**

* **is just a hint** that it is acceptable to run a callable unit of code
  concurrently,

* as long as it has finished (and possibly returned a result) latest when
  the `get`-call returns, which has bee invoked on the `std::future`.

.W[
Be sure **not** to use the default launch policy but specify concurrent
execution explicitly (see next page) whenever it is essential that two

It is a well known effect that too many parallel threads of execution may rather
degrade performance. Especially if threads are CPU bound, it makes little sense
to have more threads as cores. Therefore the standard gives considerable freedom
to the implementation, which might implement concurrency with `std::async` with
a thread pool and turn to synchronous execution or lazy evaluation at a certain
threshold.

template: plain
header: #### Explicit Launch Policies

There is a second version of `std::async` which has a first argument to specify
the launch strategy. 

The standard defines two values:

* `std::launch::async`  
  if **not set** the callable will **not** run on its own thread;._[]

* `std::launch::deferred`
  of **set** the callable will **not** be called before `get` is invoked.

logic independent from possible problems created through race conditions or
deadlocks, originating from dependencies between the "independent tasks", that

template: plain
header: #### Catching Exceptions

If the callable started via `std::async` throws an exception, it will appear as
if it were thrown from the call to get.

Hence, if the asynchronously run task may throw, fetching the result should be
done in a try block:
```
auto task1 = std::async( … ); // whatever-is-to-do (and may throw)
auto task2 = std::async( … ); // whatelse-is-to-do (and may throw)
…
try { … task1.get() … }
} catch ( … ) { // what may be thrown from whatever-is-to-do
   … // handle the case that whatever-is-to-do threw
}
try { … task2.get() … }
} catch ( … ) { // what may be thrown from whatelse-is-to-do
   … // handle the case that whatelse-is-to-do threw
}
```

Assuming the transformation is to calculate square roots and there are
two arrays of size `N`, say

workers may be created (to be handed over to `std::async`) as follows:._[]
```
std::size_t processed_count = 0;
auto worker_task =
    [&]() { worker(data, N, sqrts, processed_count,

    w = std::async(worker_task);

    try { w.get(); } catch (...) {}

template: plain
name: mutexes_and_raii
header: #### Mutexes and RAII

As the mutex operations **lock** and **unlock** need to come correctly paired,
they make a good candidate to apply a technique called [RAII].._[]

It works by creating a wrapper class, executing

* the acquiring operation (or *lock*-ing in this case) in its constructor, and
* the releasing operation (or *unlock*-ing) in its destructor.

Such helper classes are available in C++11 `std::lock_guard`.

The big advantage is that unlocking the mutex is guaranteed for code blocks
defining a RAII-style (guard) object locally, no matter whether control
flow reached its end, or by `break`, `return`, or some exception.

Mutexes in C++11 come in a number of flavours, which controlling their behaviour
with respect to the following details:

* Whether or not some thread that already locked a mutex may lock it once more
  (and needs to release it as often).

* Whether or not a thread waits if it finds a mutex locked by some other thread,
  and in the latter case until *when* (clock-based time point) or or *how long*
  (duration) it waits.

For all mutex variants there are also variants of RAII-style lock guards.

---
template: plain
name: mutexes_and_raii
header: #### Defeating Deadlocks Caused by Mutex-Locking

As a potentially blocking mechanism mutexes are famous for creating deadlocks, i.e

* in the situation where two resources *A* and *B* are required,
* one thread acquires these in the order *first A, then B* and
* another thread acquires these in the order *first B, then A*.._[]

The obvious counter measure is to acquire locks always in the same order,
as achievable with `std::lock` and `std::try_lock`.

.I[
For more information on locking several mutexes semantically atomic (i.e.
without creating the potential for dead-locks) see:
http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/lock and

]

.F[:
In practice, the potential for deadlocks is often not as obvious as in this
example but much more intricate and close to impossible to spot, even in
scrutinising code reviews. So, if (accidental) deadlocks cannot be avoided,
sometimes a "self-healing" strategy is applied that works follows:  
**If more than one lock needs to be acquired, acquire at least all others with
setting a time-out.** If that hits, **release all locks** acquired so far,
**delay** for some small amount of time (usually determined in a window with
some slight randomness), then **try again** (and maybe in a different order).

template: plain
name: onetime_execution
header: ### One-Time Execution

For a particular scenario that would otherwise require the use of mutex-es to
avoid a [Race Condition], there is pre-built solution in C++11.

Executing a piece of code exactly once can be achieved in a cookbook-style as
follows:
```
// in a scope reachable from all usage points:
std::once_flag this_code_once;
…
std::call_once(this_code_once, …some callable… ); // somewhere
…
std::call_once(this_code_once, … ); // maybe somewhere else
```

For any of the callables associated with the same instance of an
`std::once_flag` via `std::call_once`, without further protection via mutexes
it is guaranteed that **at most one** is executed **at most once**.

[Race Condition]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition

---
template: plain
name: onetime_execution
header: #### One-Time Execution Example

A typical use case for guaranteed one-time execution is some initialisation,
that may be expensive and is therefore delayed until a function that depends
on it is called the first time.

The following fragment avoids parallel initialisations of `table`:
```
… foo( … ) {
    static std::once_flag init;
    static std::array<int, 1000> table;
    std::call_once(init, [&table]) {
        … // precalculate table when foo runs for the first time
    });
    … //
}
```

it seems to guarantee …._[]

.F[:
The example code shown does **not** guarantee that from several concurrently
executing threads all will see a **fully** initialised table – it only

exactly once and from exactly one thread.

template: plain
name: onetime_execution

   … //

the initialisation of static locals, also this is guaranteed to work:._[]

A well-known abstraction in concurrent programming are

One main use of condition variables is to **avoid busy waiting** in

The following *RingBuffer* class can put condition variables to good use …
```
template<typename T, std::size_t N>
class RingBuffer {
    std::array<T, N+1> buf;
    std::size_t p = 0, g = 0;
    bool empty() const { return p == g; }
    bool full() const { return (p+1) % buf.size() == g; }

    void get(T &val) {
        if (empty())
            … // handle case no data is available
        val = buf[g++]; g %= buf.size();
    }
};
```
… exactly at the currently omitted points.

---
template: plain
name: condition_variables
header: #### Condition Variable Example (2)

Obviously there are two conditions, that need special attention:

* The buffer may be full when `put` is called, or
* it may be empty, when `get` is called.

Therefore two condition variables._[] are added, furthermore a mutex to protect
accessing the buffer:
```
class RingBuffer {
    … //
    … // as before
    … //
    std::condition_variable data_available;
    std::condition_variable space_available;
    std::mutex buffer_access;
public:

one condition variable would suffice, but for this introductory example using
two different instances seems to be clearer.

    void put(const T &val) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(buffer_access);

        buf[p++] = val; p %= buf.size();
        data_available.notify_one();
    }
    void get(T &val) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(buffer_access);
        data_available.wait(lock, [this]{ return !empty(); });

Waiting on a condition variable – as shown on the last page – with

   space_available.wait(lock, [this]{ return !full(); });
```
```
// as part of get:
   std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(buffer_access);
   data_available.wait(lock, [this]{ return !empty(); });
```

is equivalent to the following, **with the mutex being locked before**:

.pull-left[
```
// as part of put:
   while (full()) { // !!full()
       buffer_access.unlock();
       // wait for notification
       buffer_access.lock();

   while (empty()) { // !!empty
       buffer_access.unlock();
       // wait for notification

template: plain

header: #### Spurious Wakeups

In the example code before, the loop (in the equivalent of `wait`-ing) may seem
unnecessary, as the respective notification will be sent only after some action
has made the condition true.

Nevertheless it makes sense and may even be necessary:

* **First of all, an implementation is allowed to give [Spurious Wake-Up]s,
  so the loop is necessary anyway.**

* If notifications are sent while nobody waits on the condition variable, it is
  simply discarded, therefore

  * a producer-consumer scenario is more robust if it tends to send "too many"
    notifications (of which some are discarded) …
  * … while sending "too few" could cause some thread to wait forever.

So far the presentation of C++11 concurrency support was only meant as an
overview.

.W[
Practically using concurrency features beyond parallelizing independent tasks
requires much more knowledge and experience in this area, what this presentation
can not provide.

A good and near to exhaustive coverage of the concurrency part of C++11 is:

header: ## Boost: Threads Library

[Boost.Thread]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/thread.html

As C++11 threads emerged from [Boost.Thread] there is little difference.

Some differences between C++11 and Boost may exist (depending on the version
of the latter) and new features may appear and be tried in Boost first before
eventually getting part of an upcoming C++ standard.

.N[
There are many reasons why a pure library solution may have practical
difficulties to properly support concurrency.

Most important is in the memory model, which needs to be clearly defined so
that optimising compilers are restricted to the necessary limits – but not
(too far) beyond these.._[]

.F[:
A related, easy to recognize problem that demonstrates why concurrency cannot
be added as a library alone but must be part of the core language part, can be
seen when considering a long-existing features of C which is also part of C++:
the initialization of local `static` variables. By definition this takes place
when the definition is reached in the program flow for the first time and hence,
in the general case must be protected with a mutex (or similar) to avoid race
conditions (except for initialisation with a compile-time constant that can be
loaded at program startup).

name: boost_asio
header: ## Boost: Asio

[Boost.Asio]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/boost_asio.html

The purpose of [Boost.Asio] is to support event-driven program designs by
providing a framework to dispatch incoming events to previously registered event
handlers:

* The largest group of events deals with I/O, especially the arrival of data
  from asynchronous sources (like sockets).

* Besides that it allows also an applications to send events to itself, maybe
  with a specified delay.

Event handlers are run single-threaded and hence there is no need for
synchronisation as is in multi-threaded designs. For good responsiveness an
event driven program design must keep event handlers small.

.N[
Especially an event handler should **never** delay or wait for responses of
an external client – rather register an handler to be started when the
response arrives.
