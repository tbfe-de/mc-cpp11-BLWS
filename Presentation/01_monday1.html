template: plain
name: cpp11_syntax_cleanups
header: ## C++11 – Syntax Cleanups

An important syntax cleanup is to allow to write adjacent *less-than* signs as
closing angle brackets for template argument lists:._[]
```
map<string, vector<int>> wordposlist;
```

.F[:
It should be noted that this change breaks previously valid code that used the
right-shift operator in an expression to specify a template value argument.
Therefore `g++` changes its behaviour depending on the option `-std=c++11`
(or `-std=c++0x` for less recent versions). Old code with shift operators as
part of a template value argument must put the expression in parentheses.
]

While some compilers (like Visual Studio) since long handled the above
according to the C++11 rules, others (like GCC) required this:
```
map<string, vector<int> > wordposlist;
```

Some extra-careful developers even wrote:
```
map<string, vector<int>/**/> wordposlist;
```

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_auto_typed_variables
header: ## C++11: `auto`-typed Variables

The old C keyword `auto` has changed its meaning with C++11:

* It now specifies that the type for some variable is deduced from its
  initializing expression.

* Note that type modifiers may be added but also might be stripped from the
  initializing expression.._[]

```
auto x = 3;         // x has type int
auto y = 0uL;       // y has type unsigned long
auto p1 = &x;       // p1 has type int*
auto *p2 = &x;      // p2 has type int* too (!)
const auto cx = 42; // cx has type const int BUT ...
auto ncx = cx;      // ... ncx has type int (NOT const int)
int &ri = x;        // ri has type int& BUT ...
auto nri = x;       // ... nri has type int (NOT int&)
```

.F[:
The rules are very close to the rules applied when for template functions types
are deduced from actual arguments.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_builtin_decltype
header: ## C++11: Builtin `decltype`

The compiler-builtin `decltype` is now available to

* determine the type of a variable or

* an expression (which will not be evaluated!)

```
// continuing the example from the previous page
… decltype(x) …              // represents type int
… decltype(ri) …             // represents type int&
… decltype(x+y) …            // represents type unsigned long
… decltype(std::sqrt(-1)) …  // represents type double
```

.I[
One main use for `decltype` is in templates to determine the result of an
operation with operands of a dependant type.._[]
]

For more information see: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype

.F[:
If the type is necessary for the result of a function the new suffix return
type syntax of C++11 comes in handy.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: BoostBook: typeof
name: boost_type_of
header: ## Boost: Type-of

[Boost.Typeof]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/typeof/refe.html
[`auto`]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/typeof/refe.html#typeof.auto
[`decltype`]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/typeof/refe.html#typeof.typo

Also [Boost.Typeof] provides extensions similar to [`auto`] and [`decltype`].

As these had to be implemented as library functionality._[] they

* are much more limited and clumsy to use,

* result in less readable code.

.F[:
Of course, where C++98 compilers provided useful non-standard extensions the
Boost functions made use thereof.
]

.N[
Therefore it can be expected that such parts of Boost become obsolete as soon
as C++11 is implemented by all compilers relevant for productive use with a
software project's code base.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_uniform_initialization
header: ## C++11: Uniform Initialization

C++ traditionally had many forms of initialization, some of which were limited
to certain contexts:
```
int x = 0;                     // traditional style
const std::string greet("hi"); // constructor style
struct s {
    int a;
    char z;
} v = { 42, '!' };             // aggregate initialization
std::string empty();           // INVALID (as initialization)
unsigned u = unsigned();       // not common but valid (in C++)
```

Since C++11 curly braces may be used in any initialization context:._[]
```
int x{0};                      // explicit zero initialization
const std::string greet{"hi"}; // initialization by constructor
string empty{};                // valid for default constructor
unsigned u{};                  // implicit zero initialization
```

.F[:
Compared to classic initialization some rules have slightly changed:
E.g. if the value of the initializing expression cannot be represented in
the initialized variable, this is a compile time error.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_initializer_lists
header: ### C++11: Initializer Lists

Initializer lists are sequences of comma-separated values enclosed in curly
braces.

* They are valid wherever a function accepts an argument of type
  `std::initializer_list`.

* This includes many constructors for standard containers:._[]

.W[
A few usage forms introduced ambiguities for which C++11 defined disambiguating
rules – sometimes little intuitive ones.
]
```
vector<short> primes({ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 });
const map<string, string> words = {
    { "zero", "null" }, { "one", "eins" }, { "two", "zwei" },
    …
};
vector<int> x{3};  // A vector initialized with a "list" just
                   // holding a single 3?
                   // Or rather a vector sized to 3 elements
                   // that shall be default-initialized?
```

---
template: refersto
see_also: BoostLibs: utility/value_init
name: boost_value_initialized
header: ### Boost: Value Initialized

[Boost.Value_initialized]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/utility/value_init.htm

Using the correct initialization syntax can pose a problem._[] at times:
```
template<typename T> void foo() {
    T local = … // ???
    …
}
```

* A plain `T local;` would default initialize classes but leaves basic types
  uninitialized.

* Classic style `T local = 0`; would only zero-initialize basic types.._[]

[Boost.Value_initialized] provides a utility template, causing either zero or
default initialization, depending on the type of `T`:
```
value_initialized<T> local; // uniform use of the Boost solution
T local = T();       // a (somewhat lesser known) C++98 solution
T local{};           // C++11 uniform initialization as solution
```

.F[:
Actually the state of affairs is a bit more complicated: The above would also
work if `T` were a class with a (non-`explicit`) constructor taking an argument
type to which `0` can be converted. Besides all arithmetic types this include
`bool` (`0` converted to `false`) and any pointer type (`0` converted to
`nullptr`).
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: BoostLibs: assign/doc/index
name: boost_container_initialization
header: ### Boost: Container Initialization

[Boost.Assign]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/assign/doc/index.html

[Boost.Assign] provides some operator overloading to allow a more readable
initialization syntax for sequential and associative containers.

Overloaded `operator,` and `operator+=` help with sequential containers:
```
vector<int> primes;
primes += 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29;
```

For associative containers there is a somewhat tricky overload of `operator()`
(function call):
```
map<string, string> words;
words(("one")("eins"))
     (("two")("zwei"))
     …
     (("nine")("neun"))
     ;
```

.N[
Compared to [C++11 initializer lists](#cpp11_initializer_lists) the above not
only looks clumsy but also has the draw-back that no `const`-qualifiers are
possible.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_range_based_for_loops
header: ## C++11: Range-Based `for` Loops

C++11 supports a new and uniform syntax to loop over all elements in a
collection:
```
vector<int> primes;
…
for (auto v : primes)
    … // access element through v
```
Nothing changes if `primes` were any other sequential or associative
container._[], a built-in array, or even an `std::initializer_list`:
```
for (auto v : { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 })
    … // access element through v
```

.F[:
For maps the placeholder variable will be an `std::pair` to access the key via
`v.first` and the associated value via `v.second`.
]

.N[
It is only little effort – if there is no standard iterator interface anyway –
to make user-supplied containers iterable with range based loops.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: BoostBook: foreach
name: boost_foreach
header: ## Boost: Foreach

[Boost.Foreach]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/foreach.html

Like some other third party libraries._[] [Boost.Foreach] tries to outwit C++98
with a macro – called `BOOST_FOREACH` in this case – that mimics what has become
a built-in in C++11:

```
vector<int> primes;
…
BOOST_FOREACH(int v, primes)
    … // access elements via v
```

.F[:
An assembler code analysis of `BOOST_FOREACH` is still pending on behalf of the
author of this text. But it was done for the Qt version once, and in that case
the result was a convincing argument **against** using such trickery … at least
when code efficiency is the primary target: For built-in types Qt's for-each
produced as much as ten times the amount of code compared to a classic `for`
loop!
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_move_semantics
header: ## C++11: Move Semantics

[RVO and NRVO]: http://stupefydeveloper.blogspot.de/2008/10/c-rvo-and-nrvo.html
[Perfect Forwarding]: http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_07.html

Move semantics provide the solution to two problems that could not (always)
be avoided in C++98:

* Efficient use of *value types as function return values*, e.g. if they
  represent large containers.

* Implementing types that are *movable* but not *copyable*.._[]

.F[:
With C++98 there is no real solution to the problem to differentiate between
moveable and copyable types. Even if `operator=` stays undefined and overloaded
global functions `assign` and `move` were used consequently, especially in
type-generic code of template implementations something in the vein of
[Perfect Forwarding] could not be achieved, at least not with as little code
as can now.
]

.I[
Even before C++11 in many practical cases the leeway given to a compiler to
apply [RVO and NRVO] could achieve much to **return large data structures by
value efficiently**.
]

But as there is no guarantee in this respect, the usual recommendation for C++98
was to hand-out large containers via reference arguments, not by return value –
and this recommendation should possibly be followed even in C++11.

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_rvalue_references
header: ## C++11: Rvalue References

[Rvalue References]: http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_01.html

Move semantics heavily build on [Rvalue References] defined with a double
ampersand:
```
void foo(const T &classic_reference) { … } //first
void foo(T &&rvalue_reference) { … } //second
```

With the above two overloads C++11 would bind

* the first `foo` to arguments that are plain variables (including `const`
  qualified variables),

* the second `foo` to arguments that are temporaries which will be destroyed
  soon after use.._[]

```
T a; const T b; extern T bar();
foo(a);	    // calls first
foo(b);	    // calls first
foo(bar()); // calls second
foo(a+a);   // calls second -- provided T supports operator+
```

.F[:
Such as function calls, but also including constants and expressions (with some
reasonable exemptions).
]

---
template: plain
header: ## Copyable and Movable Types

Instances of the following class will be both, copyable and movable:._[]
```
class MyClass {
    …
public:
    MyClass(const MyClass &); // classic copy constructor and ...
    const MyClass& operator=(const MyClass &); // copy assignment
    …
    MyClass(MyClass &&);        // C++11 move constructor and ...
    const MyClass& operator=(MyClass &&);      // move assignment
};
```

By supplying both of move and copy support, or only the one or the other, or
none at all, instances of `MyClass` can easily be made

* **Copyable** and **Movable**,
* **Copyable** but not Moveable,
* not Copyable but **Movable**, or
* neither Copyable nor Moveable.

.F[:
Whether it makes sense to return the assigned-to object as a `const` or a
non-`const` reference is discussed controversly with pro's and con's on both
sides.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_defaulted_deleted
header: ### C++11: `default`-ed and `delete`-d Operations

C++11 furthermore provides a particular syntax to request or forbid compiler
generated constructors and assignments, making it easy to write a class that
supports the required behavior:._[]
```
class MyClass {
    …
public:
    MyClass(const MyClass &)                   = delete;
    const MyClass& operator=(const MyClass &)  = delete;
    …
    MyClass(      MyClass &&)                  = default;
    const MyClass& operator=(      MyClass &&) = default;
 };
```

.N[
It is probably easy to understand that instances of the above class will be
**moveable but not copyable** and what needs to be changed if that should be
changed.
]

.F[:
In case the default implementation provided – which is member-wise move (and
member-wise copy if it were also `default`-ed) is inappropriate a specific
implementation can be supplied as usual.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: BoostBook: core
name: boost_noncopyable
header: ## Boost: Noncopyable

[`boost::noncopyable`]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/utility/utility.htm#Class_noncopyable

As C++ always generates a copy constructor when none is specified,._[] the usual
technique is to *declare-but-not-implement* the unwanted operation.

.F[:
Note that with C++11 the rules changed in so far as **no default copy-constructor
will be provided if a move-constructor is provided**, and the same holds for copy-
and move-assignment. The reasoning behind that rule is that as soon as a specific
behavior is necessary for one, copy or move, it will probably also be the case for
the other.
]

Via deriving from [`boost::noncopyable`] the intent can be made more obvious
(and code a bit more compact):
```
class MyClass : boost::noncopyable {
    …
    … // whatever (but no need any more to define
    … // operations that never get implemented)
    …
};
```

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_static_assertions
header: ## C++11: Static Assertions

[`static_assert`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/static_assert

With C++11 [`static_assert`] arbitrary compile time checks can be expressed to abort a
compilation. They are sometimes useful inside templates and available
for

* code blocks (mixed with code to execute at runtime) and

* class definitions (outside executable code blocks).

```
template<typename T, size N>
class RingBuffer {
    static_assert(N < 1000, "unreasonable large size");
    …
};
```
 
Since C++17 the second argument is optional.

.I[
For more complicated tests static assertions may want to move the actual
calculations to a [`constexpr` Function](#cpp11_constexpr_functions).
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: BoostBook: static_assert
name: boost_static_assert
header: ## Boost: Static Assert

[`BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT`]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/boost_staticassert.html

Static assertions are also available from Boost via

* [`BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT`]

but as prior to C++11 such assertions had somehow to "be turned into ordinary
syntax errors" the error messages finally issued tended to be less indicative
of the problem or even slightly misleading.._[]

.F[:
A common technique was to turn the assertion into the definition of an array
with a zero or negative size, which is illegal in C and C++.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_constexpr_functions
header: ## C++11: `constexpr` Functions

If a function is marked with the new `constexpr` keyword it will – given it
adheres to certain limitations – be "compiled inside the compiler" and hence be
callable at compile time.

Besides possible performance improvements for functions called with
compile-time constants as arguments anyway, the result of such functions can be
used in any context that requires a compile-time constant.._[]

.F[:
With the cases of practical importance being array dimensions, template value
arguments, static assertions, or in turn arguments to call other `constexpr`
functions.
]

```
constexpr bool is_pwrof2(unsigned v) {
    return v != 0 && (v == 1 || (!(v & 1) && is_pwrof2(v >> 1)));
}
…
const unsigned N = 4095; // should always be some 2^n - 1
static_assert(!is_pwrof2(N+1), "N is not some 2^n - 1");
```

---
template: plain
name: template_typedefs
header: ### Compile-Time Calculations with Templates

Prior to C++11 compile-time calculations had to be carried out using
meta-programming techniques based on templates:._[]
```
template<unsigned long long v>
struct is_pwrof2 {
    static const bool result = !(v & 1)
                            && is_pwrof2<(v >> 1)>::result;
};
template<> struct is_pwrof2<0uLL> {
    static const bool result = false;
};
template<> struct is_pwrof2<1uLL> {
    static const bool result = true;
};
```

The "call syntax" for such a function._[] – when `N` is another compile-time
constant – will be: `… is_pwrof2<N>::result …`

.F[:
Differently from `constexpr` functions, which will be also available with a
run-time version to be called with non-constant arguments, a function
implemented with meta-programming techniques via a template could of course
not be called in a loop for testing purposes!
]

---
template: plain
name: template_typedefs
header: ### Support for Meta-Programming in Boost

[Boost.Hana]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/hana/doc/html/
[Boost.MPL]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/mpl/doc/index.html
[Boost.Fusion]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/fusion/doc/html/
[Meta-Programming with Templates]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming

Though `constexpr` functions provide a nice alternative to template-based
techniques when non-trivial calculations have to be carried out, there are
numerous other applications of meta-programming with templates.

In such cases there will most probably be the need

* to *"operate on types"* (single ones or lists thereof)

* as *"input to"* and "output from" a metaprogram.._[]

.N[
[Boost.Hana], [Boost.MPL], and [Boost.Fusion] are a *Libraries for
Meta-Programming* with STL-like containers and algorithms – besides other
useful things.
]

.F[:
As [Meta-Programming with Templates] is a large and demanding topic that alone
could fill some days in a course like this, it will not be covered any further
(except on special demand). In general meta-programs type calculations are
dominant and only occasionally mixed with value-based calculations.
Nevertheless "meta-programmer" may sometimes have to *cross the compile-time to
run-time border*. Besides suppurt for the latter Meta-Programming Libraries
provide containers capabable of storing types and algorithms to handle their
content compile time.
]

---
template: plain
name: template_typedefs
header: ## C++11: Template Typedefs

Despite the name._[] this new C++11 syntax is not limited to templates –
instead it can fully replace the classic `typedef` syntax:

.F[:
The name is a relict from the motivation finally leading to the syntax shown
here, which provided a more general solution than originally was aimed for.
]

.pull-left[
```
// old style typedef-syntax:
typedef unsigned long METER;
typedef void *pointer_type;
typedef const char *(*CV)(int);
```
]

.pull-right[
```
// new style using-syntax:
using METER = unsigned long;
using pointer_type = void*;
using CV = const char* (int);
```
]

Finally the motivating (and name-giving) example:
```
template<typename CharType, std::size_t AllocSize>
class basic_fstring {
    …
};
template<std::size_t N> using fstring = basic_fstring<char, N>;
template<std::size_t N> using wfstring = basic_fstring<wchar_t, N>;
```
