template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 5.4.4
name: cpp11_std_function
header: ## C++11: Callables (`std::function`)

C++11 adds a template to represent *Callables*.

This templates is kind of a *Compile Time Wrapper Class Generator*
manufactoring objects with an overloaded function call operator.

Such objects can be initilalized with:

  * Classic C Function Pointers

  * [C++11 Lambdas](#cpp11_lambdas)

  * [C++ Function Objects](#function_objects) aka Functors._[]

.F[:
The term functor is commonly applied if the main purpose of a class instance is
to be *called like a function* (via its overloaded `operator()`). A typical example
is shown when Classic C++ Function Objects are covered.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_std_function
header: ### C++11: `std::function` Template Instantiaton

As `std::function` is a template._[], instantiation arguments have to be supplied.

The Syntax should be obvious from the following examples:

```
std::function<void()> f1;      // no args, returns nothing

std::function<int(int)> f2;        // int arg, returns int

                                       // const char* arg,
std::function<double(const char *)> f3;  // returns double

                    // const char*, const char**, int arg,
                                         // returns double
std::function<double(const char *, const char**, int)> f4;
```

.N[
Encoded in the *type* of an `std::function` are the types of its arguments and the
return type.
]

.F[:
Actually function objects are an application of an C++ idiom known as [Type Erasure].
]

  [Type Erasure]: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Type_Erasure

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_std_function
header: ### C++11: `std::function` Initialization / Assignment

On initialization, or when assigned to, a function object accepts anything

* that can be called as a function,

* with the required number of arguments,

* returning a value of the required type.._[]

.F[:
The actual rules are a bit more complicated and allow certain type conversions
to occur at the actual call. E.g. a function actually returning an `int` may be
assigned to an `std::function` assuming that nothing is returned. The return
value will be discarded if the function is called through the `std::function`
object.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_std_function
header: ### C++11: `std::function` Calls

Calling a function through an `std::function` uses exactly the same syntax as any
ordinary function call.

The following example should only demonstrate the principle, it has no real use:
```
#include <cstdlib>
#include <functional>

std::function<int(const char *)> f;

int main() {
    f = std::atoi;
    return f("42");
}
```

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_std_function
header: ### C++11: `std::function` Testing

Similar to a classic function pointer -  **which an `std::function` isn't(!)** -
it may not refer to a callable entity at some point in time:

1. If it is defined but not initialized.

2. If it is explicitely cleared.

This can be checked by simply using the `std::function` object in a boolean context:

```
#include <cassert>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <functional>

int main() {
    std::function<int(const char *)> f;
    assert(f == false);
    f = std::atoi;
    assert(f == true);
    f = nullptr;
    assert(f == false);
}
```

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_std_function
header: ### `std::function` Efficiency

The implementation of `std::function` need not be fully understood._[] - it can just
be used "cookbook-style" ... but two key points to keep in mind:

1. Calls through an `std::function` involve calling a virtual member function,
   i.e. there is always the overhead of a function [v]call at assembler level
   (*jsr-rts*) - so typically **no inlining possible**.

2. If the first restriction is acceptable, prefering an `std::function` over a
   generic type may help to avoid code bloat.

.F[:
Type erasure works (approximately) along the following lines:
```
  // modelled here for the case function<int(bool, const char *)> only:
struct Fwd { virtual Fwd *clone() =0; virtual int call(bool, const char *) =0; virtual ~Fwd() {} };
template<typename ActualImplementor> struct SpecificForwarder : public Fwd {
    ActualImplementor implementor;
    SpecificForwarder(const ActualImplementor &impl) : implementor(impl) {}
    virtual Fwd *clone() { return new ActualImplementor(implementor); }
    virtual int call(bool b, const char *s) { return implementor(b, s); }
};
struct TypeErased {
    std::unique_ptr<Fwd> fwd;
    template<typename T> explicit TypeErased(const T &impl) : fwd(new T(impl)) {}
    TypeErased(const TypeErased &other) : fwd(other.fwd ? other.fwd->clone() : nullptr) {}
    int operator()(bool b, const char *s) { return fwd->call(b, s); }
    â€¦ // more ops not shown (assignment, test for empty etc.)
};
```
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_std_function
header: #### Using `std::function` vs. Fully Generic Types (1)

A predicate in a (templated) algorithm could be restricted to a callable type
via `std::function`:

```
template<typename T1, typename T2>
T2 filter(T1 beg, T1 end, T2 to,
          std::function<bool(typename T1::value_type)> pred) {
    while (beg != end) {
        if (pred(*beg))
            *to++ = *beg++;
    }
    return to; // <-- !!! correct this in print-outs
}
```

If the above is not `inline` and

* if `T1` and `T2` denote (maybe different to each other) types

* which are the same for many calls,

there will be **only one single** instantiation of this function, i.e. the
instantiation will **not** depend on the predicate actually used in a call.

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_std_function
header: #### Using `std::function` vs. Fully Generic Types (2)

In contrast to the previous example, with the following template the compiler is
able to - **and often will**._[] - inline the predicate evaluation, resulting in
more or less "code bloat".

```
template<typename T1, typename T2, typename T3>
T2 filter(T1 beg, T1 end, T2 to, T3 pred) {
    while (beg != end) {
        if (pred(*beg))
            *to++ = *beg++;
    }
    return end;
}
```

.I[
Whether this is relevant for an application or not depends on many considerations.
Therefore no general rule or guideline can be given which solution to prefer over
the other.
]

.F[:
Whether the actual predicate evaluation will be inlined also depends on other
factors, like its definition is visible (and maybe explictely made `inline`),
or its a classic function for which at the call site only an `extern` declaration
is known.
Also note that different compilers may vary in handling the above and the final
result may depend on the optimization level requested.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: SchÃ¤ling: 3.4
name: boost_function
header: ## Boost: Callables

[Boost.Function]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/function.html

C++11 `std::function` emerged from [Boost.Function]

There are few differences, the most important is that `boost::function` tried
to be compatible with older compilers that did not fully support the required
*Prefered Syntax*.

So Boost supplied its *Portable Syntax* as an alternative:

```
boost::function0<void> f1;     // no args, returning nothing
boost::function1<int, int> f2;     // int arg, returning int
boost::function1<double>, const char *> f3;
boost::function3<double, const char *, const char**, int> f4;
```

* It encodes the return type as first template argument,

* followed by the argument types (if any), and

* reflects the **number of arguments** in the class name.

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 6.9
name: cpp11_lambdas
header: ## C++11: Lambdas

Introducing *Lambdas* with C++11 was a major step to bring C++ at level with
many other modern programming laguages, in which

* functions not only were made *"First Class Citiziens"* but

* it is also possible to specify a function body **at its point of use**,._[]
  especially as argument to some other function call.

.N[
The general definition syntax

* starts with a capture list in square brackets,

* followed by an argument list in round parenthesis,

* followed by the function body in curly braces.
]

.F[:
This is why lambdas are also known as *Function Literals*.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_lambdas
header: ### Lambda 101 - Definition Syntax Example

Building on the `filter` algorithm from a prior slide._[] the predicate
could be supplied directly and clearly visible at the call site:

```
std::vector<double> data, result;
â€¦ // fill data
filter(data.begin(), data.end(), std::back_inserter(result),
       [](double e) { return (e < std::sqrt(2.0)); }
};
```

.N[
Note that the above will work with either version of filter, the one with the
predicate parametrized to any type and the one with the predicate limited to
an appropriate `std::function`.
]

.F[:
An algorithm like this is available as `std::copy_if` in C++11.
(It was actually missing from C++98 where `std::replace_copy_if` had to be used
with the predicate logic inverted.)
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_lambdas
header: ### Lambda 101 - Capture Lists (Motivation)

It should be understood that for any function (say: `filter`) expecting some
other function as argument,

* the function handed over **by the callere** (as argument to `filter`)

* must **exactly match** the call coded inside (the implementation of `filter`).

Therefore it is not possible to hand over additional arguments directly:

```
filter(data.begin(), data.end(), std::back_inserter(result),
       [](double e, double max) { return (e < max); }
};
```

.N[
The above will **not compile** because the lambda handed over violates the
expectation `filter` has about the use of its fourth argument.._[]
]

.F[:
How the error manifests in a compiler diagnostic is a different issue:
if - after some type decuction - `filter` had an argument of type
`std::function<bool(double)>` the compiler will complain at the call-site
not beeing able to initialize the predicate argument from what is specified;
for a fully generic template it will probably complain **inside** the code
of the template where the actual call is coded.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_lambdas
header: ### Lambda 101 - Capture Lists (Example)

In a capture list variables from the local context may be named.

Then in the code generated for the lambda that argument is transfered
via a special path.._[]

```
double max;
std::cin >> max;
â€¦
filter(data.begin(), data.end(), std::back_inserter(result),
       [max](double e) { return (e < max); }
};
```

So far this presentation only tried to give some first clues
about the purpose and use of lambda capture lists.

.N[
There are many more details which have not been covered yet, like handing
over references in the capture list or some shortcuts for it.
]

Please lookup more information in the relevant reference documentation.

.F[:
If you are curious about that you will get an idea when
[Classic C++ Function Objects](#function_objects) are covered.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_lambdas
header: ### Lambda 101 - Be Aware of the Pitfalls

For efficieny reasons C++11 does **not demand any special rules for
stack unwinding** when a lambda captures a local context by rerefence.._[]

```
function<void()> foo(int n) {
    return [&n]() { std::cout << n; }
}
â€¦
foo(42)();
```

.W[
Therefore the above code fragment steps into the area of undefined behavior.
]

* Of course, the situation might go unnoticed for a long time as the correct
  value just happens to be in the expected memory location ...

* **... until, some day, a completely unrelated change is made ...**

.F[:
It is basically a similar situation as returning the address of a local variable
from a function, which is undefined behavior since the first days of C. But while
most any decent compiler will warn about this, the problem shown here most often
still goes unnoticed. It can be expected that code like that above will also
trigger a warning when future C++ compilers improve their checks in this respect.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 6.10
name: function_objects
header: ## Classic C++ Function Objects

Prior to C++11 lambdas - in C++98 and C++03 - code that can now be written
elegantly with lambdas had to be written with *functors*:._[]

```
struct LessCompare {
    const double limit;
    LessCompare(double lim) : limit(lim) {}
    bool operator()(double e) { return (e < limit); }
};
â€¦
double max;
std::cin >> max; // only as example (max not known at compile-time)
â€¦
filter(data.begin(), data.end(), std::back_inserter(result),
       LessCompare(max)
);
```

.F[:
To avoid unnecessary complexity the `LessCompare` functor was not written as
a template here. Of course this could have been easily done (and in practice
probably would have done) to make the functor applicable to any type supporting
`operator<()`
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: SchÃ¤ling: 5.4
name: boost_lambda
header: ## Boost: Lambdas

As lambdas were missing for a long time from the C++ language proper, it
was tried to emulate them via the library.

* Expression templates appeared to be a promising solution.

* To rewrite the example that has been used a number of times:

```
#include <boost/lambda/lambda.hpp>
â€¦
filter(data.begin(), data.end(), std::back_inserter(result),
       boost::lambda::_1 < max);
```

The innocuous looking `boost::lambda::_1` above together, with a clever
overloaded of `operator<`, triggers a complex template based machinery.

.N[
Last and finally a functor is created that overloads `operator()` to be
callable with a single argument, returning `true` if the argument is less
than `max`.
]

---
template: plain
name: boost_lambda_details
header: ### Boost: Lambda Details

While C++11 lambdas now provide a much more general and flexible solution, it
can be argued that Boost lambdas are less blatant and in many simple cases
are create with much fewer key strokes.._[]

.N[
This is especially true if the namespace `boost::lambda` is opened via a `using`
 directive, because then the occurence of the plain indentifiers `_1`, `_2`, or
`_3` in an expression is sufficient to trigger the mechanism.
]

```
std::vector<double> data;
â€¦
sort(data.begin(), data.end(), (_2 < _1)); // sort data in reverse
```

The above example, rewritten for C++11 lambdas, nicely illustrates the point:
```
sort(data.begin(), data.end(), [](double lhs, double rhs) {
                                   return (rhs < lhs);
                               }); // sort data in reverse
```

.F[:
Whether or not this is considered to be an issue to guide a decission pro or
contra Boost lambdas may also depend on the capabilities of an IDE, which -
if properly configured - might also insert a source code templates for a
C++11 lambdas with a keyboard shortcuts.
]

---
template: plain
name: boost_lambda_trivial
header: ### Boost: Lambda Beyond Trivial Use

Beyond the trivial use in pure expressions - and even their sometimes - Boost
Lambdas (or rather the expression templates behind them) can quickly get
intricate.

While it is well possible to translate the following into a Boost Lambda,
you probably will not want to do it wherever it can be avoided.._[]

```
vector<double> data;
â€¦
int line{0};
std::for_each(data.begin(), data.end(),
              [&line](double e) {
                  std::cout << ++line << ':' << e << '\n';
                  if (line % 10 != 0) std::cout << "---\n";
              });
```

.F[:
Of course, if you really have to back-port the above code written for C++11 to
some older compiler it may be good to know that Boost Lamdas stretch far beyond
the simple, expression-like use cases and all the typical flow control directives
are supported too.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_vs_boost_lambda
header: ### C++11 vs. Boost Lambdas

Which one to prefer cannot be generally decided:

* For very simple expressions Boost lambdas may be considered as an alternative.

* On the other hand, as soon as the situation is a bit more involved, the
  correct use of Boost lambdas quickly becomes tricky at least.

* Generally speaking there is a steep learning curve beyond the trivial
  cases, especialy when flow control beyond pure expressions is required.

.N[
Surely it will not make much sense to rewrite all usages of Boost Lambdas now
that C++11 lambdas are available.._[]
]

.F[:
Except of course, Boost lambdas are the only or one of only a few dependencies of
a C++ project to Boost and there is the demand to remove all such dependencies.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 6.10.3
name: cpp11_bind
header: ## C++11: Binders (`std::bind`)

Binders are a mechanism that may or may not._[] be preferred over lambdas in simple
situations where

* a new function is created from an existing one

  * and either the new function needs fewer arguments (some arguments of the
    other function will receive fixed values)

  * or requires its arguments specified in a different order from a given call
    (which may e.g. dictated by an algorithm to which the resulting function
    is given as argument)

  * or both.

.F[:
Whether or not to use binders at all or stick purely with lambdas seems to be
mainly a matter of taste. 
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_bind_example1
header: ### Reducing Number of Arguments with `std::bind`

In the following `std::bind` adapts the function `bar`, which has three
arguments, to be called from inside `foo` with only two arguments and the
middle argument fixed to the square root of two:
```
#include <functional>
using namespace std::placeholders;
extern void bar(int, double, const char *);
â€¦
foo(std::bind(bar, _1, std::sqrt(2.0), _2));
```

.N[
It should be noted that the highest placeholder number used (`_2` above)
determines argument count of the function returned from `std::bind`.
]

Also note that the placeholders can be used unqualified here because they
have been imported from their (sub-) namespace.._[]

.F[:
Because of the identical names such use may collide with placeholders of 
Boost Lambda. So special care has to be taken when `std::bind` is mixed
with other libraries that use such placeholder names too for their own
pruposes.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_bind_example2
header: ### Changing Order of Arguments with `std::bind`

In the following the `std::bind` adapts the function `baz`, which has two
arguments to be called from inside `foo` with the arguments reversed:
```
#include <functional>
using namespace std::placeholders;
extern void baz(const char *, int);
â€¦
foo(std::bind(baz, _2, _1));
```

It is also possible to drop arguments completely:._[]
```
foo(std::bind(baz, _2, 42));
```

.N[
In both cases `std::bind` returns a function to be called with two arguments,
determined by the placeholder `_2`.
]

.F[:
Dropping the last argument would require a less obvious technique like
using the comma operator to discard the begin of an expression sequence:
`foo(std::bind(baz, (_2, "hello"), _1));`
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_bind_example2
header: ### Binding Member Functions

It is also possible to use `std::bind` for objects and their members - shown
here only for member functions but it works the same for any accessible member
data.

The only thing special here is that objects are bound as if they were the
member function's first argument.._[]

The next two examples assume the following class:
```
class MyClass {
    â€¦
    void f(int);
    void cf(int) const;
    int g(char) const;
};
```

.N[
To make the following examples applicable in a cookbook-style, they introduce
[Reference Wrappers](#ref_cref) which are more fully covered only later.
]

.F[:
In other words: more or less binding simply makes explicit what is happening
anyway ("behind the scenes") whenever a member function is called ...
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_bind_example2_1
header: #### Binding Member Functions to Same Object

It is possible to bind the same object to various arguments:._[]
```
MyClass mc;
std::vector<int> v;
std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(),
     std::bind(&MyClass::cf, mc, _1));
```

As `std::bind` uses value arguments the following may help to improve
performance ...
```
std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(),
     std::bind(&MyClass::cf, std::cref(mc), _1));
```

... or even be necessary to make modifications visible:
```
std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(),
     std::bind(&MyClass::f, std::ref(mc), _1));
```

.F[:
Note that `std::for_each` was chosen here only because it constitutes a very
simple example. Especially given range-based loops in C++11 the above could
well be replaced with: `for (auto e : v) mc.cf(e);`
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_bind_example2_2
header: ### Binding Member Functions to Different Objects

Also various objects may be bound to call the same member function._[]
```
std::vector<MyClass> v;
â€¦ // fill v
auto n = std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0,
              std::bind(&MyClass::g, _1, 'a'));
â€¦
std::list<int> result;
std::transform(v.begin(), v.end(),
               std::back_inserter(result),
               std::bind(&MyClass::g, _1, 'z'));
```

Rewritten to range based loops the above is equivalent to:
```
int n{0};
for (const auto &e : v) n += e.g('a');
â€¦
for (const auto &e : v) result.push_back(e.g('z'));
```

.F[:
It should be understood that these examples are different from the ones on the
last slide as `_1`  now refers to the object from the container and triggers
generating the appropriate expression template, so a reference wrapper would
be misplaced here.

header: ### Binding Member Different Objects to Differently

Generally speaking, possible limitations are not so much imposed by `std::bind`
as by what algorithms exist.._[]

As there exists a variant of `std::transform` processing two containers in parallel,
a selected member function may also be applied to different objects with different
arguments:
```
std::string s;
â€¦ // fill s;
assert(s.size() >= v.size());
std::transform(v.begin(), v.end(), s.begin(),
               std::back_inserter(result),
               std::bind(&MyClass::g, _1, _2));
```

Translated into a range-base loop the above is equivalent to:
```
auto z{s.cbegin()};
for (const auto &e : v) result.push_back(e.g(*z++));
```

.F[:
Not to say: The possibly limited knowledge of developers with respect to the
algorithms available in C++11 and Boost ... well, that's not you as you're here
now :-)

name: bind_vs_lambda
header: ### `std::bind` vs. C++11 Lambdas

Everything that can be achieved with `std::bind` can be achieved with lambdas too.

The mose important difference is that with lambdas the argument types are a bit
more explicit:._[]
```
foo([](int _1, const char *_2) { bar(_2, std::sqrt(2), _1); });
foo([](int _1, const char *_2) { baz(_2, _1);               });
foo([](int   , const char *_2) { baz(_2, 42);               });
foo([](int _1, const char *  ) { baz("hello", _1);          });
```

.N[
The above example emphasizes this similarity by using `_1` and `_2` as name for
the formal lambda arguments.
]

Usually such names are rather chosen according to their purpse, like:
```
foo([](int count, const char *name) { baz(name, count); });
```

name: boost_bind
header: ## Boost: Binders

[Boost.Bind]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/bind/bind.html

C++11 `std::bind` emerged from [Boost.Bind].

There are few differences most of which are related to lifted restrictions
because C++11 supports true variadic templates.

* With `std::bind` the maximum number of arguments of **the adapted function**
  is essentially unlimited, while

* the maximum number of arguments for the function returned from `std::bind`
  is determined by the highest placeholder number defined in an implementaion
  (and therefor implementation defined).

.N[
For `boost::bind` there is a fixed limit._[] for both, the number of arguments
of the adapted function and the number of arguments of the function returned.
]

.F[:
Prior to the installation of Boost a configuration step may be run in which
such configuration values can be changed - typically at the price of header
file size and hence longer compilation time (with negative impacts probably
only for unreasonably large limits).
]

name: ref_cref
header: ## Reference Wrappers

At many places C++ prefers handling (copies of) values:

* Often this is safer and relieves the developer from the burden of caring about
  aliasing issues or memory ownership.

* Where necessary references instead of a values can be explicitely chosen.

* In case of library functions the interface somtimes cannot be changed
  easily, here reference wrappers may be inserted instead.

Reference wrappers have already been used in two prior
[examples for `std::bind`](#cpp11_bind_example2_1):

* One such use (`std::cref`) was only to improve performance,._F[]

* without the other (`std::ref`) the code wouldn't have worked as intended.

.F[:
Not all uses of `std::cref` are only to improve performance - for classes which make
their objects non-copyable they may be necessary so that the code compiles in the
first place.
]

template: plain
name: cpp11_ref_example1
header: ### Reference Wrapper Example (1)

The following function `print` automatically inserts line breaks if
otherwise a given length would be exceeded:

```
void print(std::string word, unsigned maxlen, unsigned &filled) {
    if (filled + word.length() > maxlen) {
        std::cout << '\n';
        filled = 0;
    }
    if (filled > 0) {
        std::cout << ' ';
        ++filled;
    }
    std::cout << word;
    filled += word.length();
}
```

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_ref_example2
header: ### Reference Wrapper Example (2)

Assuming there are a number of words in (of type `std::string`) in any
sequential container `text`, the above function could be adapted to
be used with `std::for_each`:
```
unsigned line_filled = 0;
auto p80 = std::bind(print, 80, line_filled);
std::for_each(text.begin(), text.end(), p80);
```

A first text shows that it works as expected. But it fails if the text
comes in two containers `text` and `moretext` where the second should
continue in the last line of the first, if it's only partially filled:
```
std::for_each(moretext.begin(), moretext.end(), p80);
```

.W[
The reason is that `std::bind` takes its arguments by value, so the
reference to `filled` which is modified actually isn't `line_filled`.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_ref_example3
header: ### Reference Wrapper Example (3)

The solution is to connect `line_filled` through a reference wrapper.

This is most easily done by the helper function `std::ref`:._[]
```
auto p80 = std::bind(print, 80, std::ref(line_filled));
```

There is also a *constant reference* version `std::cref`, providing
a solution for constant but non-copyable types that need to be bound:
```
class MyClass {
    â€¦
    MyClass(const MyClass &) = delete;
    â€¦
};
â€¦
MyClass obj;
void foo(â€¦, const MyClass &arg, â€¦);
â€¦ std::bind(foo, â€¦, obj, â€¦) â€¦            // COMPILE ERROR
â€¦ std::bind(foo, â€¦, std::cref(obj), â€¦) â€¦ // OK
```

name: cpp11_tuple
header: ## C++11: Tuple

Tuples are kind of ad-hoc structures and are mainly used to temporarily combine
several unrelated values to be handled as unit, e.g. in a function result.

The similarity of `std::tuple` to `std::pair` for the above use case is obvious
and if tuples had been part of C++98 they would have probably been used in some
places were currently `std::pair` is used.

.N[
Because the number of elements in a tuple is unlimited,._[] their can be no names
(like `first` and `second` in a pair) and a different technique must be applied
to access the individual parts of a tuple.
]

.F[:
Interrestingly, the other border case are not tuples with a single element, but
completely empty ones. These not only may have some use in very generic, templated
data structures but can also help to write compile time algorithms processing all
elements of a tuple. This can be done by recursive calls of a variadic templates,
terminated with a specialization for the (degenerate) empty tuple.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_tuple_def_init
header: ### Definition and Initialization of `std::tuple`

When defining a tuple the type of its elements may be explcitely defined:
```
std::tuple<int, double, const char *> t;
```

This may - of course - be combined with an initialization:._[]
```
std::tuple<int, double, const char *> t{42, std::sqrt(2), "hello"};
```

Types can be omitted by using `auto`:
```
auto t = std::make_tuple(42, std::sqrt(2), "hello");
// or:
auto t(std::make_tuple(42, std::sqrt<float>(2), "hello"));
```

But - as a subtlety of "uniform initialization" - the following creates a tuple
too, though quite a different one:
```
auto t{std::make_tuple(42, std::sqrt(2), "hello")};
```

.F[:
And of course any old initialization syntax may be used here in place of
the curly braces style.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_tuple_get_element
header: ### Element Access of `std::tuple`

To access individual elements a global getter-function must be used:
```
â€¦ std::get<0>(t) â€¦	// the int
â€¦ std::get<1>(t) â€¦	// the double
â€¦ std::get<2>(t) â€¦	// the const char *
```

.W[
It should be understood that the "element index" for `std::get` has
to be a compile time constant.
]

Therefore the following will not work:._[]
```
for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) std::cout << std::get<i>(t) << '\n';
```

.F[:
There are ways to print all the elements of a tuple - but it must
be done with a "loop unrolling itself" completely at compile time,
as for each element a different overload of `operator<<` might have
to be used.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_tuple_unpacking
header: ### Unpacking an `std::tuple`

There is a different technique that unpacks all elements of a tuple
at once:
```
int count;
double value;
const char *name;
std::tie(count, value, name) = t;
```

Obviously this has its greatest advantage if all values have to go into
a variable of their own, or at least most values:
```
int count;
std::string name;
std::tie(count, std::ignore, name) = t;
```

.N[
Compared to element access with `std::get` it is said that a small overhead
may be imposed by using `std::tie`, but if any it, is far from substantial.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_tuple_modification
header: ### Modifying `std::tuple`

As `std::get` returns a reference, it is straight forward to modify individual
elements of a tuple:
```
std::get<0>(t) = 12;
std::get<1>(t) *= 2;
```

Tuples can be also modified as a whole, only given each of their elements are
assignment compatible:
```
std::tuple<int, double> t1{3}, t2{12, std::sqrt(2)};
auto t3 = std::make_tuple(true, 0u);
t1 = t2; t2 = t3; t3 = t1;
```

Assigning all elements at once fails if (some or all) are `const`-qualified:
```
std::tuple<const int, double> t4{-1, 0.0};
const std::tuple <int, double> t5{0, 0.0};
t1 = t4; // OK (of course can assign FROM const)
t4 = t1; // FAILS because of const first member
t5 = t1; // FAILS because all members are const
std::get<1>(t4) = std::get<1>(t1); // OK
```

name: boost_tuple
header: ## Boost: Tuple

C++11 `std::tuple` emerged from `boost::tuple`.

There are few differences most of which are related to lifted restrictions
because C++11 supports true variadic templates.

* With `std::tuple` there is no upper limit to the number of contained elements.

* For `boost::tuple` the maximum is limited - usually to 10 or 20, depending on
  the configuration step run as first thing when the Boost installation.

Another difference is that `std::tuple` can **only** be accessed with the
global getter while `boost::tuple` also has a member for that purpose.
In the following fragment `t` is assumed to be a tuple with at least three
elements:
```
â€¦ std::get<2>(t) â€¦  // C++11 and Boost
â€¦ t.get<2>() â€¦      // Boost only
```

name: boost_optional
header: ## Boost: Optional

The use of `boost::optional` may be considered as an alternative to using
pointers and having the `nullptr` represent the case: does not exist.

* Differently from the pointer approach with `boost::optional` no heap
  allocation will occur.

  * Instead `boost::optional` reserves space for its payload data type
    and a flag (e.g. on the stack in case of a local variable) ...

  * ... using *Placement New* when the payload space is to be initialized ...

  * ... or a direct destructor call when it is made invalid.

```
boost::optional<int> x; // default initialized ...
assert(!x);             // ... it's not yet valid ...
x = 42;                 // ... now gets assigned ...
assert(x);              // ... tested here ...
assert(x.get() == 42);  // ... retrieved here
```

template: refersto
see_also: SchÃ¤ling: 14.3
name: boost_any
header: ## Boost: Any

The use of `boost::any` may be considered as an alternative to using
untyped pointers (`void *`) to achieve "runtime polymorphism" for types
that cannot related by a common base class.

* Internally `boost::any` refers to the assigne data via a `void*` member ...

* ... but with an additional member tracks the type assigned last ...

* ... for which it can be queried with a convenient syntax.

```
boost::any x;               // default initialized to nullptr
if (â€¦)                      // depending on a runtime condition ...
    x = true;               // ... may actually hold a boolen ..
else if (â€¦)                 // ... or in a different case ...
    x = std::sqrt(2.0);     // ... may actually hold a double ..
else if (â€¦)                 // ... or yet differenly ...
    x = std::string("hi!"); // ... an std::string ...
else                        // ... or ...
    x = â€¦;                  // ... (who knows?)
```

---
template: plain
name: boost_any2
header: ### Boost: Any (cont.)

To access a `boost::any` its content type must always be tested for.

There is a rather systematic way to do so:._[]

```
if (bool *p = boost::any_cast<bool>(&x)) {
    â€¦ *p â€¦
}
else if (double *p = boost::any_cast<double>(&x)) {
    â€¦ *p â€¦
}
else if (std::string *p = boost::any_cast<std::string>(&x)) {
    â€¦ *p â€¦
}
```

.N[
The pointers `p` can also be `auto` or `auto *`-typed.
]

That way there is **only one** type to adapt when a code block gets copy-pasted
to implement a new type case branch.

.F[:
Here a lesser known feature from C++98 is at work, allowing to define a
variable inside an `if`-condition so that it gets local scope, limited to
the statement or block following, much like it is often used for counting
variables in `for` loops.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: SchÃ¤ling: 14.4
name: boost_variant2
header: ## Boost: Variant

The type `boost::variant` is similar to `boost::any` with the important exception
that the set of types must be known at compile time.._[]

```
boost::variant<bool,
              std::string,
              double> x;  // from a (default initialized) bool
â€¦                         // (as bool is the first on the list)
x = std::sqrt(2.0);       // can be set to any other type from
â€¦                         // the list, either exactly matching
x = std::string("hello"); // but also applying conversions, if
â€¦                         // an unambiguous choice can be made,
x = "world";              // like const char * to std::string
x = nullptr;              // or nullptr_t to bool (-> false)
```

.N[
Therefore it can be used as replacement for a classic C-style `union` augmented
with a type tracking member, that is automatically set on initialization and
assignment.
]

.F[:
Effectively this means that there is a closer coupling to the client code as for
``boost::any``, where the set of types involved of course is also fixed in the
source code, but more remotely, i.e. only in the context of initialization,
assignment, and value access.
]

---
template: plain
name: boost_variant2
header: ### Boost: Variant (cont.)

A variant can be accessed in several ways:

* Specifying the expected type directly, e.g. with `boost::get<bool>(x)`, with an
  exception thrown when the content is different.

* By trying a type with `auto *p = boost::get<bool>(&x)`, followed by an explicit
  or implicit test of `p` against the `nullptr`.._[]

* With a compile time variant of the visitor pattern.

```
struct process : boost::static_visitor<> {
    void operator()(bool b) const { â€¦ } // process content if bool
    void operator()(double d) const { â€¦ }         // ... if double
    void operator()(const std::string &s) const { â€¦ }  // ... etc.
};
â€¦
boost::apply_visitor(process(), x);
```

.N[
Note that applying a visitor detects missing cases at compile time!
]

.F[:
In so far similar to `boost::any` but with slightly different syntax.
]

---
template: plain
name: boost_variant3
header: ### Boost: Variant (cont.)

In vistor-style there is also the option to fold cases with common source code
into a template, while still keeping special cases special:._[]
```
struct print : boost::static_visitor<> {
    std::ostream &os;
    print(std::ostream &os_) : os(os_) {
        os.setf(ios::boolalpha);
    }
    template<typename T> void operator(const T &v) const {
        os << v;
    }
    void operator(const std::string &v) const {
        os << '"' << v << '"';
    }
};
â€¦
boost::apply_visitor(print(std::cout), x);
```

.N[
Missing type cases now might not have the required implementation.
]

.F[:
For `boost::variant` an overloaded `operator<<` is already defined though without any
special-casing.
