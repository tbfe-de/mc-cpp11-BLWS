template: plain
name: stl_containers_recap
header: ## STL Containers (recap)

The STL and its template-based containers are at the heart of reusable library
components standardized with C++98 (besides character strings and I/O-streams).

While there originally where

* three sequential containers, and

* four associative containers,

**C++11** had extended this by

* two more to a **total of five sequential containers**, and

* four more to a **total of eight associative containers**.

---
template: plain
name: sequential_containers
header: ### Sequential Containers

Sequential containers more or less reflect typical basic data structures:

[`std::array`]:        http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array
[`std::deque`]:        http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/deque
[`std::forward_list`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/forward_list
[`std::list`]:         http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/list
[`std::vector`]:       http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector

* Contiguous memory …

  * … of fixed size: [`std::array`] (new in C++11)

  * … with heap allocation: [`std::vector`]

* Lists were elements point to each other …

  * … singly linked: [`std::forward_list`] (new in C++11)

  * … doubly linked: [`std::list`]

* Finally a mix of both in form of …

  * … adjacent memory in distributed chunks: `std::deque`._[]

.F[:
Abbreviating *Double Ended Queue* but pronounced as "deck".
]

---
template: plain
name: sequential_containers
header: #### Choosing from Sequential Containers (1)

If the choice is based on the required operations and their performance:

* When size can be fixed at compile time, `std::array` is best.._[]

* If insertions and extractions need to occur at both or at different ends,
  this leaves `std::list` and `std::deque` …

* … otherwise `std::vector` would be a good default choice.

* Furthermore `std::array` and `std::vector` are the only to choose from when
  memory layout compatible to native arrays is mandatory.

* If random access is required `std::array`, `std::vector` and `std::deque`
  are the candidates …

* … otherwise, if insertions and extractions need to be efficient
  everywhere `std::list` and `std::forward_list`.
  
.F[:
The picture is slightly different if only the *maximum size* can be fixed at
compile time: depending on what is to be stored, an `std::array` may rule out
itself when there is no way to tell "valid" from "invalid" elements and there
is no suitable (default) constructor for the latter ones.
]

---
template: plain
name: sequential_containers
header: #### Choosing from Sequential Containers (2)

If the choice is based on

* frequent sequential traversal

* **not** intermingled with frequent insertions and deletions

* on hardware with of highspeed cache lines in fast memory (close to the CPU)
  and – in comparison – slow main memory
  
then the appropriate choice is

* either `std::array` (size pre-calculated for worst case and fixed compile
  time)

* or `std::vector` (infrequent growth, either at startup or in peaks during
  special loading phases)


.N[
Sequentially storing elements adjacent to each other (or more generally in
close proximity, with respect to the access pattern) will be a large benefit.
]

---
template: plain
name: associative_containers
header: ### Associative Containers

Associative containers can be grouped around three dimensions:

* Whether they contain a key value pair or just a key:

  * `map`-types versus `set`-types

* Whether duplicate keys are allowed:

  * `multi`-types versus the others.

* Whether the underlying data structure is based on hashing or a tree:

  * `unordered`-types versus the others.

Viewed pragmatically the data structure rather impacts the following:

* Need lookups be as fast as possible (O(1) even for huge collections)?

* Will there be sequential processing with preferred order of traversal?

If the first is more important as the second, prefer hash-based variants, if
vice versa the tree-based ones.

---
template: plain
name: associative_containers
header: ### Small Container Optimzations

Optimizations "behind the scenes" for containers holding only few elements is
mostly impossible due to the STL specification.

.N[
Only for containers **not** giving the guarantee that iterators stay valid over
insertions and deletions._[] such optimizations can actually be transparently
implemented.
]

Thereforethey are limited to:

* `std::vector` (depending on the element type)

* `std::string` (and maybe `std::wstring`)

.F[:
Of course with the exception of elements deleted ...
]

---
template: plain
name: stl_container_adapters
header: ## STL Container Adapters

There are a number of use patterns for which the standard STL containers are
more powerful as desirable – or in other words:

* where some operations should be completely taken away,

* or be made available in a limited or different form.

This is the problem that adapters are designed to solve.

---
template: plain
name: stl_stack_adapter
header: ### Stacks

[`std::stack`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/stack

The [`std::stack`] adapts a container so that insertions and deletions can take
place only at the same end.

* The default underlying container is an `std::deque` but also `std::vector` or
  `std::list` can be chosen.._[]

* Instead of "back" and "front" as conventionally used for a sequential
  container

  * the most recent element (inserted last) is named "top", and

  * at that end elements are simply "push"-ed and "pop"-ed.

* Also there is no iterator style (or other) interface to iterate over the whole
  content.

.F[:
Interestingly an `std::forward_list` cannot be adapted to a stack, though it
implements perfect stack semantics. This is because a stack adapter expects to
work at the "back"-side of its underlying container, not the "front"-side that
the singly linked list exposes.
]

---
template: plain
name: stl_stack_example
header: #### Stack Code Examples

The following shows a possible way to fill …
```
std::stack<int> data;
…
int x;
while (std::cin >> x)
    data.push(x);
```

… and to extract from a stack;
```
while (!data.empty()) {
    std::cout << data.top() << ' ';
    data.pop();
}
```

---
template: plain
name: stl_queue_adapter
header: ### Queues

[`std::queue`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/queue

The [`std::queue`] adapts a container so that insertions and deletions can take
place only at different ends.

* The default underlying container is an `std::deque` but also `std::list` can
  be chosen.

* The "back" and "front" ends as conventionally used for a sequential container
  are kept, with

  * the most recent element (inserted last) is "push"-ed to the "back", and

  * the least recent element (inserted longest ago) may be "pop"-ed from the
    "front".

* Also there is no iterator style (or other) interface to iterate over the whole
  content.

---
template: plain
name: stl_queue_example
header: #### Queue Code Examples

The following shows a possible way to fill …
```
std::queue<int> data;
…
int x;
while (std::cin >> x)
    data.push(x);
```

… and to extract from a queue;
```
while (!data.empty()) {
    std::cout << data.front() << ' ';
    data.pop();
}
```

---
template: plain
name: stl_priority_queue_adapter
header: ### Priority Queues

[`std::priority_queue`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/priority_queue

Considering its core interface an [`std::priority_queue`] is similar to an
`std::queue`.

* The default underlying container is an `std::vector`.

* Elements are "push"-ed and "pop"-ed …

  * … while any extraction takes place on the "top" …

  * … which is the largest element currently contained.

* For flexibility the sort criteria may be specified at construction time.

.N[
Priority queues can be – and probably are – implemented based on the STL
algorithms for managing heap data structures.._[]
]

.F[:
Here the term heap is used differently from its usual meaning, which is to refer
to the *free store area* of the (technical) execution model.
]

---
template: plain
name: stl_priority_queue_example
header: #### Priority Queue Code Examples

A priority queue storing `int`-s in the default order (extract greatest first)
…
```
std::priority_queue<int> pq1;
```

… which is the same as specifying all defaults explicit …
```
std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::less<int>> pq1;
```

… and vice versa (extracts smallest first):._[]
```
std::priority_queue<int>, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> pq2;
```

.F[:
As the sort functor is the third template argument, the second (the container on
which the priority queue is based) must be specified too, even if the default
applies.
]

.N[
Note that the comparison functor orders by what goes to the top **last**!
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_new_containers
header: ## C++11: New Containers

[`std::array`]:        http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array
[`std::forward_list`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/forward_list
[`std::set`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/set
[`std::unordered_set`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_set
[`std::multiset`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/multiset
[`std::unordered_multiset`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_multiset
[`std::map`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map
[`std::unordered_map`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map
[`std::multimap`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/multimap
[`std::unordered_multimap`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_multimap
[`std::bitset`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/bitset

The following were introduced with C++11:

* [`std::array`] – a wrapper around native arrays

* [`std::forward_list`] – a singly linked list

* [`std::unordered_set`] – the hash-based version of [`std::set`]

* [`std::unordered_multiset`] – the hash-based version of [`std::multiset`]

* [`std::unordered_map`] – the hash-based version of [`std::map`]

* [`std::unordered_multimap`] – the hash-based version of [`std::multimap`]

* [`std::bitset`] is not a new container but has been slightly extended.

The iterator interface of all existing containers has been extended with the
member functions `cbegin()`, `cend()`, `crbegin()`, and `crend()` to obtain
`const_iterator`s from non-`const` containers.

---
template: plain
name: std_array
header: ### std::array

[`std::array`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array
[`std::experimental::make_array`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/make_array
[Library Fundamentals TS v2]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/lib_extensions_2

The [`std::array`] wrapper makes native arrays look like the other standard
conforming containers. It has to be instantiated with a type and a size
argument:._[]

```
std::array<double, 50> data;
```

The wrapper adds:

* Standard embedded type definitions like `size_type`, `value_type` etc.

* Standard member functions like `size()`, `empty()` etc.

* Everything required for walking over the content using the standard iterator
  interface.

The latter not only makes iterating over native arrays no more different from
the other containers but also enables range based for loops.

.F[:
The size argument cannot be omitted, even if the array definition is combined
with an initialization. There is currently a proposal
[`std::experimental::make_array`] (as part of the [Library Fundamentals TS v2])
which will fix this.
]

---
template: plain
name: std_forward_list
header: ### std::forward_list

[`std::forward_list`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/forward_list
[`std::list`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/list

This container makes a minimum-overhead, singly-linked list available.

It has the following differences to the probably well-known [`std::list`]:

* An [`std::forward_list`] does not know its size – so testing for contained
  elements must be with `empty()`, not `size() == 0`.

* Insertion and extraction take place at the "front"-side, hence

  * member functions `front`, `push_front`, and `pop_front` are available

  * but not their counterparts working at the "back"-side.

* When walking over the content with an iterator, it does not allow to insert
  new elements at the iterator position but only after it.

  * This is technically easy to explain as a minimum-overhead iterator can not
    know the element prior to the one it refers to.

  * Therefore the member function implementing insertion is not called `insert`
    but `insert_after`.

---
template: plain
name: hash_based_containers
header: ### Hash-based Containers

Hash-based containers will improve lookup-performance at the price that the
order, when iterating over the container, is not predictable:

* With a decent hash function most any key will be found in O(1) time – or a
  decision made that a key does not exist.

* When the container is filled by incrementally adding more elements over time,
  it also will extend its reserved space incrementally and therefore its
  elements must more or less frequently be re-hashed.

* Differently from `std::vector` iterators keep valid even when elements are
  rehashed.

* Though no specific order can be expected when walking over a hash-based
  container, elements with the same key follow each other (as elements with
  the same hash-value will do).

* Elements of a set or keys of a map are not required to implement `operator<`
  but `operator==`.._[]

.F[:
Though probably not to expect in practice this could have subtle effects if an
ordered container were exchanged with its unordered cousin or vice versa.
]

---
template: plain
name: boost_unordered
header: ## Boost: Unordered

[Boost.Unordered]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/unordered.html

If a C++ implementation does not (yet) make hash-based containers available
[Boost.Unordered] may be used as drop-in replacement.

.N[
The most important difference is that the standard containers are in namespace
`std` while their Boost couterparts are in namespace `boost`.
]

---
template: plain
name: boost_bimap
header: ## Boost: BiMap

[Boost.Bimap]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/bimap/doc/html/index.html

[Boost.Bimap] allows bidirectional key-value lookup.

```
class IP { … };   // classes for objects to map bidirectionally
class Host { … }; // to each other (also works with built-in types)
…
typedef boost::bimap<IP, Host> IP_to_Host; // define type ...
IP_to_Host nameservice;                    // ... and object
…
// fill nameservice (bidirectional map) with content:
nameservice.insert(IP_to_Host::value_type(IP(…), Host(…)));
nameservice.insert(IP_to_Host::value_type(IP(…), Host(…)));
…
// lookup now works both ways:
… nameservice.left.find(IP(…)) …    // lookup entry via IP-Number
… nameservice.right.find(Host(…)) … // lookup entry via Host-Name
```

The interface to

* `nameservice.left` is like that of a `map<IP, Host>`;

* `nameservice.right` is like that of a `map<Host, IP>`.

---
template: plain
name: boost_property_tree
header: ## Boost: Property Tree

[Boost.Property_Tree]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/property_tree.html

[Boost.Property_Tree] is a recursive data structure.

A node (starting with the single root node)

* has some data value (typically an `std::string`)

* and a list of children (empty for leaf nodes),

  * each of which holds a key (typically an `std::string`)

  * and a sub-tree starting with a node that

   * has some data value

   * and a list of children

     * each of which holds a key

     * and a sub-tree starting with …

.N.center[
In other words: a recursive data structure not limited in depth.
]

---
template: plain
header: ### Property Tree (cont.)

[JSON]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON

When represented in main memory a property tree can be navigated
programmatically (e.g. searched for sub-notes).._[]

Besides that in can be made persistent in an external representation, i.e.
written to a file and read back in a number of serialization formats:

* JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

* Info-File format (similar to JSON with lesser punctuation)

* Ini-File format (as widely used by MS-Windows "in the old days")

* XML (with a fixed conversion schema, no generic DTD or document object model)

.N[
Property trees are nicely suited for storing configuration data or state
information between consecutive program executions, though that's not their
only possible use.
]

.F[:
Navigation is only within one level, there is no automatic recursion, i.e. any
descending into a sub-tree must be explicit, it will not happen automatically.
]

---
template: plain
name: extensions_to_bitsets
header: ### C++11 Extensions to Bitsets

The `std::bitset` class from C++98 has been extended in C++11 with respect to

* conversion to the (now officially supported) type `long long`,

* a hash-function so that instances may be used in the unordered-variants of
  associative containers,

* optional arguments for the `to_string` conversion, and

* a constructor accepting an `std::string` argument.

.N[
One effect that can be achieved easily with the latter two extensions is to
convert numbers to and from a binary representation as text form, with freely
chosen characters to denote set and cleared bits.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp14_binary
header: ### C++14 Binary Literals

Binary literals have been officially added in C++14 similar to hexadecimal
literals, but the prefix `0b` (or `0b`) instead of `0x` (or `0x`):._[]
```
assert(0x2A == 0b101010);
```

It may be combined with using apostrophs for structuring literals to make them
more readable:
```
assert(0x2A == 0b10'1010); // groups of 4 ... (like hex)
// or also:
assert(0x2A == 0b101'010); // or 3 ... (like octal)
// or even:
assert(0x2A == 0b10'10'10); // or 2 ...
// or whatever:
assert(0x2A == 0b1'0101'0); // or ???
```

.F[:
Be careful when reading the example: the source code highlighter may currently
not process the apostrophs as it should!
]

---
template: plain
name: boost_binary
header: ### Binary Literals

[`BOOST_BINARY`]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/utility/utility.htm#BOOST_BINARY

With the macro `BOOST_BINARY` (defined in `<boost/utility.hpp>`) it becomes
possibilitiy to specify binary literals as series of `0` and `1`:

* `BOOST_BINARY(1 1 1 1)` yields `0xF` or `15`

* `BOOST_BINARY(1 0 1 0 1 0 )` yields `0x1A` or `42`

* `BOOST_BINARY_UL(1 0 1 0 1 0 )` yields `0x1AL` or `42uL`

* `BOOST_BINARY(100 0000 0000)` yields `0x400` or `1024`

[C++ Algorithms]:          http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm
[C++ Containers]:          http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container
[C++ Iterator Categories]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator
[Iterators]:               http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern

The STL was designed around the idea that the glue between [C++ Containers]
and [C++ Algorithms] should be provided by [Iterators] which were further
categorized by their capabilities, leading to [C++ Iterator Categories]:

* **Input- and Output-Iterators** – same operations as Forward-Iterators (see
  next) but with restrictions on the order of operations.

* **Forward-Iterators** – comparable to each other, `operator++` in pre- and
  postfix version, `operator*` for dereferencing.

* **Bidirectional-Iterators** – in addition `operator--` in pre- and postfix
  version.

* **Random-Access-Iterators** – in addition `operator+=` and `operator-=` to
  increment and decrement in steps of more than one and `operator-` to determine
  the distance between two iterators.

.N.center[
Containers document the iterator category they provide  
and Algorithms the category they require.

template: plain
name: stl_iterators_performance
header: ### STL Iterators Efficiency

[_STLP_DEBUG for STLport]: http://www.stlport.com/doc/debug_mode.html

To allow a maximally efficient implementation of iterators with respect to

* Memory Footprint and

* Runtime Performance

safety requirements were not cast into any of the C++ standards but left as a
*Quality of Implementation* (QoI) issue.._[]

.F[:
What is frequently misunderstood is that implementations actually **can** prefer
safety over efficiency; some versions of the STL have special macros that can be
defined to enable additional tests, e.g.  [_STLP_DEBUG for STLport]. If other
vendors (or free implementations) of Standard C++ do not exploit the leeway
given by the standard to add "safety" features, then presumably because there is
not that much pressure from the respective clients to have such features … or
at least not at the price to pay for it in terms of lost efficiency.
]

.N[
For most containers an iterator can be as efficient as a pointer.
]

Walking through all elements of a container with an iterator does

* not **require** any large support data structure, and

* **may** map to very few machine instructions at assembler level.

---
template: plain
name: stl_algorithms_recap
header: ## STL algorithms (recap)

Algorithms originally supplied when the STL was standardized with C++98 are too
numerous to give them full coverage here.

Instead refer to a good documentation source like named below or equivalent:

* http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm

* http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/

The following only recapitulates some of the systematic approach and after this
highlights a few C++11 extensions.

---
template: plain
name: iterator_container_interface
header: ### Iterator Interface to Containers

Algorithms usually deal with containers but abstract that fact away by taking
two iterator arguments:
```
std::vector<int> data;
…
// add all values in container
const auto n = std::accumulate(data.begin(), data.end(), 0);
```

This may seem as a minor inconvenience but easily allows for subranges without
the need for specialized algorithms:
```
assert(data.size() > 3);
// add values in container except the first two and the last
const auto n = std::accumulate(data.begin()+2, data.end()-1, 0);
```

.N[
Note that a typical requirement of algorithms is that: of the two iterators
specifying the range the second must be *reachable* from the first.
]

This means, after the first is incremented often enough it must – while staying
within the container bounds – compare equal to the second.

---
template: plain
name: iterator_generic_interface
header: ### Generic Iterator Interface

Another reason that makes the iterator interface to algorithms powerful is that
iterators are not required to connect to containers.

.N[
It can make sense to define a class that exposes the same interface as an 
iterator while actually calculating values on the run.
]

```
class Iota
    : public std::iterator<std::input_iterator_tag, int> {
    int i, s;
public:
    Iota(int i_ = 0, int s_ = 1) : i(i_), s(s_) {}

    Iota operator++() { return Iota(i += s, s); }
    Iota operator++(int) { i += s; return Iota(i - s, s); }

Given the above class a container can be filled with a number range:

std::copy_n(Iota(), 20, std::back_inserter(data));
std::copy_n(Iota(10, 3), 20, std::back_inserter(data));

[`std::ostream_iterator`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/ostream_iterator

To the degree to which it makes sense STL algorithms come in families:

* A *plain algorithm* (say: `std::remove`) does its work modifying a container,
  basing its decision (which elements to remove) on a fixed value.

* The `_copy`-version (i.e. `std::remove_copy`) leaves the original container
  unmodified, storing the result to another container._[]

* The `_if`-version (i.e. `std::remove_if`) generalizes the predicate through
  using a *Callable* as last argument (function, functor, lambda).

* If both of the above versions exist they will also be found combined into a
  `_copy_if` version (i.e. `std::remove_copy_if`).

.F[:
The target for this operation again is specified with an *iterator* that gets
used as [Output Iterator](#stl_iterators_recap); usually it will be kind of an
inserter, i.e. [`std::back_insert_iterator`] or [`std::front_insert_iterator`]
for sequential containers, [`std::insert_iterator`] for associative containers,
or [`std::ostream_iterator`] for output streams.

header: ### Using Algorithms on Native Array

With native pointers used as iterators, all of the STL algorithms can also be
used to process native arrays.

.N[
There is a price to pay: any algorithm that logically removes values cannot
make a native array smaller – so it returns the new end.._[]
]

```
int data[1000], *data_end = data;
… // fill with values, make data_end point behind the last
std::sort(data, data_end);               // first sort then ...
data_end = std::unique(data, data_end);  // ... remove duplicates
```

Alternatively the `std::array` wrapper could be applied:
```
std::array<int, 1000> data;
auto data_end = data.begin();
… // fill and make data_end to refer after the last ...
std::sort(data.begin(), data_end));
data_end = std::unique(data.begin(), data_end);
```

.F[:
Which is the address **after** that of the last entry used – an address that is
always valid (though it *might* be the address of storage space use for a
different purpose).

template: plain
name: resizing_after_removal
header: ### Return Values from Removals

Generally algorithms that logically remove elements from a container return the
"new end".

This is also true if the physical size of the underlying container could be
made smaller, like for the sequential STL containers:
```
// assuming a container x with elements of type int:
auto new_end = std::remove_if(x.begin(), x.end(),
                              [](int e) { return (e < 42); });
```

Physically reducing the container size must happen explicitly:
```
x.erase(new_end, x.end()); 
```

---
template: plain
name: resizing_after_removal
header: ### Return Values from Filling

Many algorithms that fill a container – in case of families particularly the
`_copy`-version – return an iterator pointing after the last element copied to
the result.

This can be useful when the filling state of a native array needs to be
tracked:._[]
```
const int N = 32767;
static_assert(ckdiv2(N+1), "N must be one less than a power of two");
int data[N], *data_end = data;
for (int n = 1, i = (N+1)/2; i > 0; ++n, i /= 2)
    data_end = std::fill_n(data_end, i, n);
```

.F[:
To figure out how exactly that code initializes the container with which values
is left as an exercise for the reader :-) … if not from a code analysis then
go and wrap the above fragment into a `main`-function, compile, run, and look at
the output … (maybe reduce `N` to much smaller values, say 7, 15, 31, …).

Again the following does not intend to be exhaustive, instead it should just
highlight C++11 additions for those who know STL algorithms quite well from
C++98.

* The largest group is the one in which most algorithms start with `is_`. These
  check for certain properties of a container content.._[]

* A few algorithms have probably been added because a substantial number of
  people found them "missing".

  * Some added algorithms will actually improve performance.

  * Others could have been expressed with the available algorithms but an
    algorithm with an expressive name makes the intent clearer.

Or rather sequences, as the interface is of course through iterators, so no
underlying container needs to be exposed.

template: plain
name: container_searching
header: ### New Ways to Search through Containers

The [following algorithms](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/all_any_none_of)
take a predicate as argument to check for **each** container element. All have
the chance to shortcut the evaluation:

* `std::all_of` – can return `false` the first time the predicate is `false`

* `std::any_of` – can return `true` the first time the predicate is `true`

* `std::none_of` – can return `false` the first time the predicate is `true`

.N[
Though any of the above can be written in terms of any other, it is usually
clearest to express the intent with the fewest negations.
]

Compare:._F[]
```
std::none_of(x.begin(), x.end(), [](int v) { return (v > 0); }
!std::any_of(x.begin(), x.end(), [](int v) { return (v > 0); }
std::all_of(x.begin(), x.end(), [](int v) { return !(v > 0); }
```

For a good test whether a condition is clearly expressed imagine you read it out
to someone at the telephone. Which one of these do you think will be understood
then without any doubt or asking back?

template: plain
name: container_filling
header: ### New Ways to Fill Containers

A new algorithm to copy from one container to another one allows to specify the
number of elements instead of an end iterator.

This allows sometime for easier calculations:
```
const std::size_t Ndata = 50, Nresult = 20;
int data[Ndata], *data_filled = data;
int result[Nresult], *result_filled = result;
… // copy to data, assume it is finally filled up to data_filled
… // also assume result has now content up to result_filled
…
// copy from data to result until data exhausted or result full:
const auto available = data_filled - data;
const auto freespace = result + Nresult - result_filled;
std::copy_n(data, std::min(available, freespace), result_filled);
```

Also it is now easily possible to fill a container with increasing values:._[]
```
std::iota(data, data+Ndata, 1); // fills in: 1 2 3 4 ...
```

.F[:
Note that `std::iota` **expects container elements to exist**. E.g. if an
`std::vector` had to be filled it must be resized first.

template: plain
name: container_copysearch
header: ### Algorithms Adding Negation

[`std::copy_if`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/copy
[`std::remove_copy_if`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/remove
[`std::find_if`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/find
[`std::find_if_not`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/find

Elements to be copied from one container to another one can now be selected
with a predicate.

Given two sequential containers `x` and `result` with element type `T` the
following code would do this:
```
std::copy_if(x.begin(), x.end(), std::back_inserter(result),
             [](const T& elem) {
                 return …; // whatever needs to be checked for elem
             });
```

With a negated predicate [`std::remove_copy_if`] becomes [`std::copy_if`].

Similarly when searching for the first container element that does not have a
given property, checked with a predicate:
```
… std::find_if_not(x.begin(), x.end(), [](T elem) { return …; });
```

With a negated predicate [`std::find_if_not`] becomes [`std::find_if`].

template: plain
name: algo_improve_performance
header: ### Algorithms Improving Performance

It is now possible to search for the minimum and maximum value at the same
time, passing over the sequence only once with fewer comparisons:
```
auto result_it = std::minmax_sequence(x.begin(), x.end());
… result_it.first … // iterator denoting minimum element
… result_it.last … // iterator denoting maximum element
```

.W[
Of course, the iterators returned must not be dereferenced without a prior test
if the sequence might have been empty!
]

There is also a simpler version returning a reference to two variables:
```
int a, b;
… // fill in values
auto result = std::min_max(a, b);
… result.first … // reference to variable holding the smaller value
… result.last … // reference to variable holding the larger value
// or store into two separate variables:
int min, max;
std::tie(min, max) = std::minmax(a, b);
```

[Boost.Range]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/range/doc/html/index.html

[Boost.Range] extends the basic idea to combine iterators to pairs – called
ranges – with the goal to eliminate the need to always have to supply two
arguments when just a single container is involved.._[]

* Additional algorithms accept these ranges instead of the separate arguments
  their STL counterparts require.

* The concept of ranges is further extended so that algorithms can be glued
  together with a high degree of flexibility.

.F[:
Because the two arguments style adopted by the original STL has the advantage
that subranges do not require additional algorithms, ranges from this library
can of course not only be constructed from containers (taking `begin()` and
`end()` as range) but also from two container iterators!
