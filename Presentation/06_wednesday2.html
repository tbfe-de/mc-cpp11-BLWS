name: stl_containers_recap
header: ## STL Containers (recap)

The STL and its template-based containers are at the heart of reusable library
components standardized with C++98 (besides character strings and I/O-streams).

While there originally where

* three sequential containers, and

* four associative containers,

C++11 had extended this by

* two more to a total of **five sequential containers**, and

* four more to a total of **eight associative containers**.

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 7.3-7.5
name: sequential_containers
header: ### Sequential Containers

Sequential containers more or less reflect typical basic data structures:

* Contiguous memory ...

  * ... of fixed size: `std::array` (new in C++11)

  * ... with heap allocation: `std::vector

* Lists were elements point to each other ...

  * ... singly linked: `std::forward_list` (new in C++11)

  * ... doubly linked: `std::list`

* Finally a mix of both if form of ...

  * ... adjacent memory in chunks: `std::deque`._[]

.F[:
Abbreviating *Double Ende Queue* but pronounced as "deck".
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 7.3-7.5
name: sequential_containers
header: #### Choosing from Sequential Containers

The choice largely depends on the required operations and their performance.

* When **size can be fixed at compile time**, `std::array` is best.._[]

* If **insertions and extractions need to occur at both or at different ends**,
  this leaves `std::list` and `std::deque` ...

* ... otherwise `std::vector` would be **a good default choice**.

* Furthermore `std::array` and `std::vector` are the only to choose from when
  **memory layout compatible to builtin arrays** is mandatory.

* If **random access is required** `std::array`, `std::vector` and `std::deque`
  are the candidates ...

* ... otherwise, if **insertions and extractions need to be efficient everywhere**
  `std::list` and `std::forward_list`.
  

.F[:
The picture is slightly different if only the *maximum size* can be fixed at
compile time: depending on what is to be stored an `std::array` outrule
itself when there is no way to tell "valid" from "invalid" elements and no
suitable (default) constructor for the latter ones.
]


---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 7.7-7.8
name: associative_containers
header: ### Associative Containers

Associative containers can be grouped around three dimenions:

* Whether they contain **a key value pair or just a key**:

  * `map`-types versus `set`-types

* Whether **duplicate keys are allowed**:

  * `multi`-types versus the others.

* Whether the **underlying data structures is hash-based or a binary tree**:

  * `unordered`-types versus the others.

Viewn pragmatically the data structure rather impacts the following:

* Need lookups be as fast as possible (O(1) even for huge collections)?

* Will there be sequential processing with preferred order of traversal?

If the first is more important as the second, prefer hash-based variant, if
vice versa the tree-based one.

---
template: refersto
see_also: 
name: stl_container_adapters
header: ## STL Container Adapters

There are a number of use patterns for which the standard STL containers are
more powerful as desirable - or in other words:

* where some operations should be completely taken away,

* or be made available in a limited or different form.

This is the problem that adapters are designed to solve.

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 12.1
name: stl_stack_adapter
header: ### Stacks

The `stl::stack` adapts a container so that insertions and deletions can take
place only at the same end.

* The default underlying container is an `std::deque` but also `std::vector` or
  `std::list` can be chosen.._[]

* Instead of "back" and "front" as conventionally used for a sequential container

  * the most recent element (inserted last) is named "top", and

  * at that end elements are simply "push"-ed and "pop"-ed.

* Also there is no iterator style (or other interface) to iterate over the whole
  content.

.F[:
Interestingly an `stl::forward_list` cannot be adapted to a stack, though it
implements perfect stack_semantics. This is because a stack adapter expects
to work at the "back"-side of its underlying container, not the "front"-side
thet the singly linked list exposes.
]

---
template: plain
name: stl_stack_example
header: #### Stack Code Examples

The following shows a possible way to fill ...
```
std::stack<int> data;
…
int x;
while (std::cin >> x)
    data.push(x);
```

... and to extract from a stack;
```
while (!data.empty()) {
    std::cout << data.top() << ' ';
    data.pop();
}
```

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 12.2
name: stl_queue_adapter
header: ### Queues

The `stl::queue` adapts a container so that insertions and deletions can take
place only at different ends.

* The default underlying container is an `std::deque` but also `std::vector`
  can be chosen.

* The "back" and "front" ends as conventionally used for a sequential container
  are kept,

  * the most recent element (inserted last) is "push"-ed to the "back", and

  * the least recent element (inserted longest ago) may be "pop"-ed from the
    "front".

* Also there is no iterator style (or other interface) to iterate over the whole
  content.

---
template: plain
name: stl_queue_example
header: #### Queue Code Examples

The following shows a possible way to fill ...
```
std::queue<int> data;
…
int x;
while (std::cin >> x)
    data.push(x);
```

... and to extract from a queue;
```
while (!data.empty()) {
    std::cout << data.front() << ' ';
    data.pop();
}
```

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 12.3
name: stl_priority_queue_adapter
header: ### Priority Queues

Considering its core interface an `std::priority_queue` is similar to an 
an `std::queue`.

* The default underlying container is an `std::vector`.

* Elements are "push"-ed and "pop"-ed ...

  * ... while any extraction takes place on the "top"

  * ... which is the largest element currently contained.

* For flexibility a sort criteria is to be specified at construction time.

.N[
Priority queues can be - and probably are - implemented based on the STL algorithms for
managing heap data structures.._[]
]

.F[:
Here the term heap is used differently from its usual meaning, which is to refer to
the *free store area* of the (technical) execution modell.
]

---
template: plain
name: stl_priority_queue_example
header: #### Priority Queue Code Examples

A priority queue storing `int`-s in the default order (extract greatest first) ...
```
std::priority_queue<int> pq1;
```

... which is the same as specifying all defaults explicit ...
```
std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::less<int>> pq1;
```

... and vice versa (extracts smallest first):._[]
```
std::priority_queue<int>, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> pq2;
```

.N[
Note that the comparison functor orders by what goes to the top **last**!
]


.F[:
As the sort functor is the third template argument the second (the container on
which the priority queue is based) must be specfied too, even if the default applies.
]

template: refersto
see_also: 
name: cpp11_new_containers
header: ## C++11: New Containers

The following were introduced with C++11:

* `std::array` - a wrapper around builtin arrays

* `std::forward_list` - a singly linked list

* `std::unordered_set` - the hash-based version of `std::set`

* `std::unordered_multiset` - the hash-based version of `std::mulitset`

* `std::unordered_map` - the hash-based version of `std::map`

* `std::unordered_multimap` - the hash-based version of `std::mulitmap`

* `std::bitset` is not a new container but has been slightly extended.

* The iterator interface of all existing containers has been extended with
  the member functions `cbegin()`, `cend()`, `crbegin()`, and `crend()`
  to obtain `const_iterator`s from non-`const` containers.

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 7.2
name: std_array
header: ### std::array

This wrapper makes builtin arrays look more like standard conforming containers.
It has to be instantiaed with a type and a size argument:._[]

```
std::array<double, 50> data;
```

The wrapper adds:

* Standard embedded type definitions like `size_type`, `value_type` etc.

* Standard member functions like `size()`, `empty()` etc.

* Everything required for walking over the content using the iterator interface.

The latter not only makes iterating over builtin arrays no more different from the
other containers, but also enables range based for loops.

On the other hand, builtin arrays are compatible with range-based for, so - if
this were the only reason to use the wrapper - it actually isn't!

.F[:
The size argument cannot be omitted, even if the array definition is combined with an
initialization!
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 7.6
name: std_forward_list
header: ### std::forward_list

This container makes a minimum-overhead, singly-linked list available.

It has the following differences to the probably well-known `std::list`:

* An `std::forward_list` does not know its size - so testing for contained
  elements must be done `empty()`, not `size() == 0`.

* Insertion and extraction take place at the "front"-side, hence

  * member functions `front`, `push_front`, and `pop_front` are available

  * but not their counterparts working at the "back"-side.._[]

* When walking over the content with an iterator, it does not allow to insert
  new elements at the iterator position but only after it.

  * This is technically easy to explain as a minimum-overhead iterator can
    not know the element prior to the one it refers to.

  * Therefore the member function implementing insertion is not called
    `insert` but `insert_after`.

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 7.9
name: hash_based_containers
header: ### hash-based containers

Hash-based containers will improve lookup-performance at the price that the
order when iterating over the container is not predictable:

* With a decent hash function most any key will be found in O(1) time - or a
  decission made that a key does not exist.

* When the container is filled by incrementally adding more elements over time,
  it also will extend its reserved space incrementally and herefore its elements
  must more or less frequently be re-hashed.

* Differently from `std::vector` iterators keep valid even when elements are
  rehashed.

* Though no specific order can be epected when walking over a hash-based container,
  elements with the same key follow each other (as elements with te same hash-value
  will do).

* Elements of a set or keys of a map are not required to implement `operator<` but
  `operator==`.._[]

.F[:
Though probably not to expect in practice this could have subtle effects if an
ordered container were exchanged with its unordered cousin or vice versa.

name: boost_unordered
header: ## Boost: Unordered

If a C++ implementation does not (yet) make hash-based containers available
[Boost.Unordered] may be used as drop-in replacement.

.N[
The most important difference is that the standard containers are in
namespace `std` while their Boost couterparts are in namespace `boost`.
]

template: refersto

name: boost_bimap
header: ## Boost: BiMap

[Boost.Bimap] allows bidirectional key-value lookup.

```
class IP { … };   // classes for objects to map bidirectionally
class Host { … }; // to each other (also works with builtin types)
…
typedef boost::bimap<IP, Host> IP_to_Host; // define type ...
IP_to_Host nameservice;                    // ... and object
…
// fill nameservice (bidirectional map) with content:
nameservice.insert(IP_to_Host::value_type(IP(…), Host(…)));
nameservice.insert(IP_to_Host::value_type(IP(…), Host(…)));
…
// lookup now works both ways:
… nameservice.left.find(IP(…)) …    // lookup entry via IP-Number
… nameservice.right.find(Host(…)) … // lookup entry via Host-Name
```

The interface to

* `nameservice.left` is like that of a `map<IP, Host>`;

* `nameservice.right` is like that of a `map<Host, IP>`.

template: refersto
see_also: BoostBook: property_tree
name: boost_property_tree
header: ## Boost: Property Tree

[Boost.Property_Tree] is a recursive data structure.

A node (starting with the single root node)

* has some data value (typically an `std::string`)

* and a list of children (empty for leaf nodes),

  * each of which holds a key (typically an `std::string`)

  * and a sub-tree starting with a node that

   * has some data value

   * and a list of children

     * each of which holds a key

     * and a sub-tree starting with ...

[Boost.Property_Tree]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/property_tree.html

---
template: plain
header: ### Property Tree (cont.)

When represented in main memory a property tree can be navigated programmatically
(e.g. searched for sub-notes).._[]

Besides that in can be made persistent in an external representation, i.e. written to
file and read back in a number of serialization formats:

* JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

* Info-File format (similar to JSON with lesser punctuation)

* Ini-File format (as widely used by MS-Windows "in the old days")

* XML (with a fixed conversion schema, no generic DTD or document object model)

.N[
Therefore property trees are well suited for storing configuration data or state
information between consecutive program exections, though that's not their sole
possible use.
]

.F[:
Navigation is only within one level, there is no automatic recursion, i.e. any
descending into a sub-tree must be explicit, it will never happen automatically.

name: extensions_to_bitsets
header: ### C++11 Extensions to Bitsets

The `std::bitset` class from C++98 has been extended in C++11 with string conversions.

.N[
One effect that can be achieved with extended bitsets is that binary numbers can
be converted from and two an representation as printable '0' and '1' characters
in a string literal or on output.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: BoostBook: core
name: boost_binary
header: ### Binary Literals

With the macro `BOOST_BINARY` (defined in `<boost/utility.hpp>`) it becomes
possibiltiy to specify binary literals as series of `0` and `1`:._[]

* `BOOST_BINARY(1 1 1 1)` yields `0xF` or `15`

* `BOOST_BINARY(1 0 1 0 1 0 )` yields `0x1A` or `42`

* `BOOST_BINARY_UL(1 0 1 0 1 0 )` yields `0x1AL` or `42uL`

* `BOOST_BINARY(10 0000 0000)` yields `0x400` or `1024`

.F[:
In C++14 internal support for binary literals is expected so that examples like
above could be written as `0b1111`, `0x101010` etc. Some C++ compilers already
support this as an exetension.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 6.3
name: stl_iterators_recap
header: ## STL Iterators (recap)

The STL was designed around the idea that the glue between *Containers* and *Algorithms*
should be provided by *Iterators* which were further categorized by their capabilities:

* **Input- and Output-Iterators** - same operations as Forward-Iterators but restricted
  order of application.

* **Forward-Iterators** - comparable to each other, `operator++` in pre- und postfix
  version, `operator*` for derefenrencing.

* **Bidirectional-Iterators** - in addition `operator--` in pre- and postfix version.

* **Random-Access-Iterators** - in addition `operator+=` and `operator-=` to increment
  and decrement in steps of more than one and `operator-` to determine distance
  between two iterators.

.N[
Containers document the iterator category they offer and Algorithms the one they
require.
]

---
template: plain
name: stl_iterators_performance
header: ### STL Iterators Efficiency

To allow a maximally efficient implementation of iterators with respect to

* Memory Footprint and

* Runtime Performance

safety requirements were not cast into any of the C++ standards but left as
a *Quality of Implementation* (QoI) issue.._[]

.N[
For most containers an interator can be as efficient as a pointer.
]

Walking through all elements of a container with an iterator does

* not **require** any large support data structure, and

* **may** map to very few assembly level instructions.

.F[:
What is frequently misunderstood is that implementations actually **can** prefer
safety over efficiency; e.g. the original STL as used internally be Hewlett-Packard
had a special macro that could be defined at compile time to enable many additional
tests. If some vendor (or free implementations) of standard C++ do not exploit the
leeway given by the standard to add "safety" features then presumably because there
is not *that* much from the respective clients to have such improvements ... or
at least not at the price to pay for it, in terms of lost efficiency.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 11.2
name: stl_algorithms_recap
header: ## STL algorithms (recap)

Algorithms originally supplied when the STL was standardized with C++98 are
too numerous to give them full coverage here.

Instead refer to a good documentation source like named below or equivalent:

* http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm

* http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/

The following only recapitulates some of the systematic approach and after
this highlights a few C++11 extensions.

---
template: plain
name: iterator_container_interface
header: ### Iterator Interface to Containers

Algorithms usually deal with containers but abstract that fact away by taking
two iterator arguments:
```
std::vector<int> data;
…
// add all values in container
const auto n = std::accumulate(data.begin(), data.end(), 0);
```

This may seem as a minor inconvenience but easily allows for subranges without
the need for specialized algorithms:
```
assert(data.size() > 3);
// add values in container except the first two and the last
const auto n = std::accumulate(data.begin()+2, data.end()-1, 0);
```

.N[
Note that a typical requirement of algorithms is that of the two iterators
specifying the range the second is *reachable* from the first.
]

This means, if the first is incremented often enough it must - while staying
within the container bounds - compare equal to the second.

---
template: plain
name: iterator_generic_interface
header: ### Generic Iterator Interface

Another reason that makes the iterator interface to algorithms powerfull is
that iterators are not required to connect to containers.

.N[
It can make sense to define a class that exposes the same interface as an 
iterator while actually calculating values on the run.
]

```
class Iota
    : public std::iterator<std::input_iterator_tag, int> {
    int i, s;
public:
    Iota(int i_ = 0, int s_ = 1) : i(i_), s(s_) {}
    int operator*() { return i; }
    Iota operator++() { return Iota(i += s, s); }
    Iota operator++(int) { i += s; return Iota(i - s, s); }
};
```

Given the above class a container be filled with a number range:
```
std::copy_n(Iota(), 20, std::back_inserter(data));
std::copy_n(Iota(10, 3), 20, std::back_inserter(data));
```

---
template: plain
name: stl_algorithm_families
header: ### Algorithm Families

To the degree to which it makes sense STL algorithms come in families:

* A *plain algorithm* (say: `std::remove`) does its work modifiying a
  container, basing its decission (which elements to remove) on a fixed
  value.

* The `_copy`-version (i.e. `std::remove_copy`) leaves the original container
  unmodified, storing the result to another container._[]

* The `_if`-versions (i.e. `std::remove_if`) generalizes the predicate throuhg
  the use a *Callable* as last argument (function, functor, lambda).

* If both of the above versions exist they will also be found combined into
  a `_copy_if` version (i.e. `std::remove_copy_if`).

.F[:
The target for this operation again is specified with an *iterator* that
gets used as *output iterator*; it will kind of an inserter.
]
  
---
template: plain
name: algorithms_for_arrays
header: ### Using Algorithms on Builtin Array

With builtin pointers used as iterators, all of the STL algorithms can also be
used to process builtin arrays.

.N[
There is price to pay: any algorithm that logically removes values cannot make
the array smaller - so it returns the new end.
]

```
int data[1000], *data_end = data;
… // fill with values, make data_end point behind the last
std::sort(data, data_end);               // first sort then ...
data_end = std::unique(data, data_end);  // ... remove duplicates
```

Alternatively the ``std::array`` wrapper could be applied:
```
std::array<int, 1000> data;
auto data_end{data.begin()};
… // fill and make data_end to refer after the last ...
std::sort(data.begin(), data_end));
data_end = std::unique(data.begin(), data_end);
```

---
template: plain
name: resizing_after_removal
header: ### Return Values from Removals

Generally algorithms that logically remove elements from a container return
the "new end".

This is also true if the phyisical size of the underlying container could
be made smaller, like for the sequential STL containers:
```
// assuming a container x with elements of type int:
auto new_end = std::remove_if(x.begin(), x.end(),
                              [](int e) { return (e < 42); });
```

Physically reducing the container size must happen explicitely:
```
x.erase(new_end, x.end()); 
```

---
template: plain
name: resizing_after_removal
header: ### Return Values from Filling

Many algorithms that fill a container - in case of families especially the
`_copy`-version - return an iterator pointing after the last element copied
to the result.

This is often useful, especially when the filling state of a builtin array
needs to be tracked
```
const int N = 32767;
static_assert(ckdiv2(N+1), "N must be one less than a power of two");
int data[N], *data_end = data;
for (int n = 1, i = (N+1)/2; i > 0; ++n, i /= 2)
    data_end = std::fill_n(data_end, i, n);
```

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_new_algorithms
header: ## C++11: New Algorithms

Again the following does not intend to be exhaustive, instead it should just
shortly highlight C++11 additions for those who know STL algorithms quite well
from C++98.

* The largest group in which most start with `is_`. These algorithms check for
  certain properties of a container content..F[]

* A few algorithms have probably been added because a substantial number of
  people found them "missing".

  * In one subgroup the new algorithms will actually improve performance.

  * Others could have been well expressed with the available algorithms but
    an algorithm with an expressive name makes the intent clearer.

.F[:
Or rather sequences, as the interface is of course through iterators, no
underlying needs to be exposed.

header: ### New Ways to Search through Containers

The following algorithms take a predicate as argument to check for each container
element, but all have the chance to shortcut the evaluation:

* `std::all_of` - can return `false` the first time the predicate is `false`

* `std::any_of` - can return `true` the first time the predicate is `true`

* `std::none_of` - can return `false` the first time the predicate is `true`

.N[
Though each of the above can be written in terms of any other, it is usually
clearest to express the intent with the fewest negations.
]

Compare:._F[]
```
std::none_of(x.begin(), x.end(), [](int v) { return (v > 0); }
!std::any_of(x.begin(), x.end(), [](int v) { return (v > 0); }
std::all_of(x.begin(), x.end(), [](int v) { return !(v > 0); }
```

.F[:
For a good test if a condition is clearly expressed imagine you read it out load
to someone at the telephone. Which one of these do you think will be understood
then without any doubt or asking back?

template: plain
name: container_filling
header: ### New Ways to Fill Containers

A new algorithm to copy from one container to another one allows to specify the
number of elements instead of an end iterator.

This allows sometime for easier calculations:
```
const std::size_t Ndata = 50, Nresult = 20;
int data[100], *data_filled = data;
int result[50], *result_filled = result;
… // data has been filled up to data_filled
… // result also has content up to result_filled;
// copy from data to result until
// - data is exhausted, or
// - result is completely full:
const auto available = data_filled - data;
const auto freespace = result + Nresult - result_filled;
std::copy_n(result_filled, std::max(availble, freespace), data);
```

Also it is now easily possible to fill a container with increasing values:._[]
```
std::iota(data, data+Ndata, 1); // fills in: 1 2 3 4 ...
```

.F[:
Note that `std::iota` expects container elements to exist. E.g. if an `std::vector`
had to be filled it must be resized first.

template: plain
name: container_copysearch
header: ### Algorithms Adding Negation

Elements to be copied from one container to another one can now be selected
with a predicate.

Given two sequential containers `x` and `result` with element type `T`
the following code would do this:
```
std::copy(x.begin(), x.end(), std::back_inserter(result),
          [](T elem) {
              return …; // whatever needs to be checked for elem
          });
```

With a negated predicate `std::remove_copy_if` will have the same effect.

Similarily when searchin for the first container element that does not
have a given property, checked with a predicate:
```
… std::find_if_not(x.begin(), x.end(), [](T elem) { return …; });
```

Again, `std::find_if` with a negated predicate will do the same search.

template: plain
name: container_copysearch
header: ### Algorithms Improving Performance

It is now possible to search for the minimum and maximum value at the same
time, passing over the sequence only once and doing lesser comparisons:._[]
```
auto result_it = std::minmax_sequence(x.begin(), x.end());
… result_it.first … // iterator denoting minimum element
… result_it.last … // iterator denoting maximum
```

.W[
Of course, the iterators returned must not be derefeneced without a prior
test if the sequence might have been empty!
]

There is also a simpler version returning a reference to two variables:
```
int a, b;
… // fill in values
auto result = std::min_max(a, b);
… result.first … // reference to variable holding the smaller value
… result.last … // reference to variable holding the greater value
// or store into two separate variables:
int min, max;
std::tie(min, max) = std::minmax(a, b);
```

name: boost_range
header: ## Boost: Range

[Boost.Range] extends the basic idea to combine iterators to pairs -
called ranges - with the goal eliminate the need to always have to
supply two arguments when just a single container is involved.._[]

* Additional algorithms accept these ranges instead of the separate arguments
  their STL counterparts require.

* The concept of ranges is then extended so that algorithm can be glued together
  with a high degree of flexibility.

[Boost.Range]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/range/doc/html/index.html

.F[:
Of course the "two arguments" style adopted by the original STL has the advantage
that subranges do not require additional algorithms that allow to specify parts
of containers.

[Boost.Algorithm]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_56_0/libs/algorithm/doc/html/index.htm

[Boost.Algorithm] is a collection of algorithms to extending the STL.

.N[
Parts of this collection have been standardized with C++11, others are intended to
become part of C++14, some will still stay "Boost only".
