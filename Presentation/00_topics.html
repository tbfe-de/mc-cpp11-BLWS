header: ### Online References

C++ has become a huge topic so it will frequently be necessary to lookup
details in an online reference.

As general C++ reference the following can be recommended:

* http://en.cppreference.com/w/ - totally free, seems to be run by enthusiasts
  and now includes even [live examples](#online_compilation)

* http://www.cplusplus.com/ - obviously financed by moderate pop-ups,
  nevertheless well organized and up-to-date

For topics specific to boost:

* http://www.boost.org - The Official Boost Site

* http://en.highscore.de/cpp/boost/frontpage.html  
  A free Online Book._[] by Boris Schäling in English Language and

* http://www.highscore.de/cpp/boost - same in German Language 

.F[:
Some of the following pages will refer to a chapter or section in their
top-right corner, so you may want to keep the table of content of this book
open in a browser tab.
]

---
template: plain
name: online_compilation
header: ### Online Compilation

A growing number of internet sites offer free._[] online compilation services
and may be tried for small examples without having a C++ compiler or even a
full IDE like Eclipse installed locally.

.F[:
At least for some sites the motivation seems to be to offer upgrades for a
fee.  Details like guaranteed up-time, safety of your code (against accidental
loss or being spied on) will then be based on the details of a service
agreement.
]

* For an overview see appendix:
  [**Online Compilation**](10_appendix.html#compile_services)

.N[
In most cases code can even be shared among developers by creating a permanent
link that can be sent around via email. Others allow the use of browser local
storage to save your code and retrieve it later.
]

---
template: plain
name: online_compilation
header: ### Online Compilation (cont.)

Especially online compilation services that allow to chose from several
compilers make it easy to find out whether some surprising behavior is just a
glitch of a particular implementation.

.W[
In case of free services you should of course not *depend* on the site
being up and available all the time and everywhere.
]

Similarly you should not count on your code is reliably saved in permanent
store, even if the service allows to "save" your code and retrieve it later.

Finally – as data is sent over the Internet – the code compiled is not
safe against preying eyes …._[]

.F[:
… so do not send out fragments for which your company (or your contractor, if
you are a freelancer) has signed an NDA.

This presentation uses a free HTML5-based slide-show tool named
[`remark`](http://remarkjs.com).

#### Viewing

You may use any recent browser of your choice.

* [JavaScript] must be enabled.
* [Modern CSS] should be supported.._[]
* Cookies are **not** used.

.F[:
Given an appropriate level of [CSS knowledge] you may be able to tweak the
appearance.

template: plain
header: ### Following Links

Many clickable links have been provided in the hope they will give the online
version an added value over the print-outs you received.

.I[
You may want to follow links when viewing this presentation by **clicking
with the CTRL-key held** down, what will open the target document in a separate
browser tab.
]

.center[
**The content of pages linked-to is outside of the author's control!**
]

---
template: plain
header: #### Prepared Printouts

Attendees of a training will receive a printed version of this document.

.I[
You may access a final electronic version including recent changes made during
this training or later via download.
]

Printable PDF files have the same base name as the HTML version with and suffix
changed to `.pdf`. E.g. a PDF of this file (assuming you currently view it in
the browser) is [`00_topics.pdf`](00_topic.pdf). 

#### DIY Printouts

[Chrome Browser]: https://www.google.de/chrome/browser/desktop/

Also, with Google's [Chrome Browser] you can create a PDF any time:

* Using *Print To File* applies a special style suitable for DIN A4
  print-outs in portrait, with the lower half of each page for your notes.

* Notes contained in the presentation **will currently not be printed**.._[]

.F[:
That option may become available in a future version.

template: plain
name: annotations
header: #### Private Annotations

The core content of this HTML file is written in readable [markdown format].._[]

.F[:
With minor extensions, if you happen to know markdown already.
]

You have the option to handle this document by purely electronic means,
*including private annotations* you may want to add.

1. Save the HTML files of the presentation locally.

2. Add annotations with a text editor of your choice.

When viewing the document in a browser you may chose to view your annotations
by changing to *presenter's mode* with the `p` key.

* **You may try it out right now - back to normal is also with `p`.**

.I[
Future versions of this presentation **may or may not** use the notes
section for their own purposes - but in any case it should be possible to merge
your private annotations with a [diff-tool].
]

[markdown format]: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown
[diff-tool]:       http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff

???
The content structure of the HTML file is as follows:
````````````````````````````````````````````````````
        (some lines of HTML leader)
        <textarea>
        …
        … first presentation page …
        …
        ---
        … second presentation page …
        ---
        …
        … (etc.)
        …
        ---
        …
        … last presentation page …
        …
        &lt;/textarea>
        (some lines of HTML trailer)
````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Lines consisting of **exactly three minus signs** (nothing else!) are page
separators.

Annotations are shown in *Presenter's View* only and must be separated from
the slide content with a line consisting of **exactly three question marks**.
````````````````````````````````````````````````````
        …
        ---
        …
        … presentation slide content …
        …
        ???
        …
        … annotations added by you …
        …
        ---
        …
````````````````````````````````````````````````````

BTW: The easiest way to include small code examples, what might be a typical
use case for private annotations, is to just indent them by four spaces -
surrounding code fragments with lines of three or more back-ticks, a markdown
extension known as [Fenced Code Blocks], is the other option.

    #include <iostream>
    int main() {
        std::cout << "hello, world\n";
    }

[Fenced Code Blocks]: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks

As we are at it go: when you have this page loaded in a text editor, with the
line above - **not displayed** when you view this in the browser - and the
paragraph before the code example you have a nice way how to embed links
without making the text flow unreadable or inconvenient to edit.

<!--
The reference in square brackets needs to be unique only within a single slide
and the line connecting the reference with the external link may be placed
anywhere in the page … and HTML comments are another way to annotate, not even
visible in the Presenter's View.
-->

LAST HINT: When loaded in a text editor you will find this final page close to
the end (or can locate it easily by searching for LAST HINT); if you start from
here instead from the top it may be be easier to discover the document
structure, as at the beginning there are first a number of layout template
pages not visible in the browser.
