Attendees of this training will receive a personal copy of the book:

.center[
The C++ Standard Library (2nd Edition)

A Tutorial and Reference

by: Nicolai M. Josuttis

[ISBN-13: 978-0-321-62321-8](http://www.josuttis.com/libbook/)
]

Many presentation slides will refer to a chapter or section of this book
in the top-right corner - so feel free to use the copy you received right
away as supplement to the print-out of the presentation.

.N.center[
Your copy of this book grants a personal free 45 day license from [SAFARI]
to access a searchable online version.._[]
]

[SAFARI]: http://www.informit.com/safari/index.aspx

.F[:
The [annotations slide](#annotations) explains how you may create web-links
from a private copy of the online version of this presentation to anywhere
you like, including this book of course. (Note that the effort to do this
makes more sense if you choose to license the online version of the book
permanently).

template: plain
header: ### Online References

C++ has become a huge topic so it will frequently be necessary to lookup
details in an online reference.

As general C++ reference the following can be recommended:

* http://en.cppreference.com/w/ - totally free, seems to be run by enthusiasts
  and now includes even [live examples](#online_compilation)

* http://www.cplusplus.com/ - obiously financed by moderate pop-ups, nevertheless
  well organized and up-to-date

For topics specific to boost:

* http://www.boost.org - The Official Boost Site

* http://en.highscore.de/cpp/boost/frontpage.html  
  A free Online Book._[] by Boris Schäling in English Language and

* http://www.highscore.de/cpp/boost - same in German Language 

.F[:
Some of the following pages will refer to a chapter or section in their top-right
corner, so you may want to keep the table of content of this book open in a browser
tab.
]

template: plain
name: online_compilation
header: ### Online Compilation

A growing number of internet sites now offer free._[] online compilation services
and may be tried for small examples without having a C++ compiler or even a full
IDE like Eclipse installed locally.

.F[:
At least for some sites the motivation seems to be to offer upgrades against
a fee. Details like guaranteed up-time, safety of your code (against accidental
loss or being spied on) will then be based on the details of a service agreement.
]

* For an overview see appendix:
  [**Online Compilation**](10_appendix.html#compile_services)

.N[
In most cases code can even be shared among developers by creating a permanent
link that can be sent around via email. Others allow the use of browser local
storage to save your code and retrieve it later.
]

template: plain
name: online_compilation
header: #### Online Compilation (cont.)

Especially online compilation services that allow to chose from several compilers
make it easy to find out whether some surprising behavior is just a glitch of a
particular implementation.

.W[
In case of free services you should of course not *depend* on the site being
up and available all the time and everywhere.
]

Similarily you schould not count on your code is reliably saved in permanent
store, even if the service allows to "save" your code and retrieve it later.

Furthermore - as data is sent over the Internet - the code compile there is not
safe ageinst preying eyes ...._[]

.F[:
... so do not send out fragments for which your company (or your contractor, if
you are a freelancer) has signed an NDA.

#### Viewing

You may use any recent browser of your choice.

* [JavaScript] must be enabled.

header: ### Following Links

Many clickable links have been provided in the hope they will give the online
version an added value over the print-outs you received.

.I[
You may want to follow links when viewing this presentation by **clicking with the
CTRL-key held** down, what will open the target document in a separate browser tab.
]

**And because the German Law seems to require it here is the usual disclaimer:**

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES NEITHER THE AUTHOR OF THIS
DOCUMENT NOR THE COMPANY OR ANY ONE ELSE WHO MADE IT ACCESSIBLE TO YOU CAN BE
HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENT OF A FOREIGN SITE THAT IS DISPLAYED AFTER
CLICKING A LINK PROVIDED HERE.

template: plain
header: #### Prepared Printouts

Attendees of a training will receive a printed version of this document.

.I[
You may access a final electronic version including recent changes made during
this training or later via download.
]

Printable PDF files have the same base name as the HTML version with and suffix
changed to `.pdf`. E.g. a PDF of this file (assuming you currently view it in
the browser) is [`00_topics.pdf`](00_topic.pdf). 

#### DIY Printouts

Also, with google's *Chrome Browsers* you can create a PDF any time:

* Using *Print To File* applies a special style suitable for DIN A4
  print-outs in portrait, with the lower half of each page for your notes.

* Notes contained in the presentation **will currently not be printed**.._[]

.F[:
That option may become available in a future version.
]

---
template: plain
name: annotations
header: #### Private Annotations

The core content of this HTML file is witten in readable [markdown format].._[]

.F[:
With minor extensions, if you happen to know markdown already.
]

You have the option to handle this document by purely electronic means,
*including private annotations* you may want to add.

1. Save the HTML files of the presentation locally.

2. Add annotations with a text editor of your choice.

When viewing the document in a browser you may chose to view your annotations by
changing to *presenter's mode* with the `p` key.

* **You may try it out right now - back to normal is also with `p`.**

.I[
Future versions of this presentation **may or may not** use the notes section for
their own purposes - but in any case it should be possible to merge your private
annotations with a [diff-tool].
]

  [markdown format]: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown
  [diff-tool]:       http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff

???
The content structure of the HTML file is as follows:
````````````````````````````````````````````````````
        (some lines of HTML leader)
        <textarea>
        …
        … first presentation page …
        …
        ---
        … second presentation page …
        ---
        …
        … (etc.)
        …
        ---
        …
        … last presentation page …
        …
        &lt;/textarea>
        (some lines of HTML trailer)
````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Lines consisting of **exactly three minus signs** (nothing else!) are page
separators.

Annotations are shown in *Presenter's View* only and must be separated from
the slide content with a line consisting of **exactly three question marks**.
```
        …
        ---
        …
        … presentation slide content …
        …
        ???
        …
        … annotations added by you …
        …
        ---
        …
```

BTW: The easiest way to include small code examples, what might be a typical
use case for private annotations, is to just indent them by four spaces -
surrounding code fragments with lines of three or more backticks, a markdown
extension known as [Fenced Code Blocks], is the other option.

    #include <iostream>
    int main() {
        std::cout << "hello, world\n";
    }

[Fenced Code Blocks]: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks

As we are at it go: when you have this page loaded in a text editor, with the line
above - **not displayed** when you view this in the browser - and the paragraph
before the code example you have a nice way how to embedde links without making
the text flow unreadable or inconvenient to edit.

<!-- The reference in square brackets needs to be unique only within a single slide
     and the line connecting the reference with the external link may be placed
     anywhere in the page ... and HTML comments are another way to annotate,
     not even visible in the Presenter's View.
-->

LAST HINT: When loaded in a text editor you will find this final page close to the
end (or can locate it easily by searching for LAST HINT); if you start from here
instead from the top it may be be easier to discover the document structure, as at
the beginning there are first a number of layout template pages not visible in the
browser.
