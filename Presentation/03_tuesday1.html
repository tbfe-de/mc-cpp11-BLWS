template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.1
name: std_string_recap
header: ## Standard Strings (Recap)

The class `std::string` was introduced in its current form with C++98.
while C++11 extended it in a number of ways it left the basic design unchanged:

* The `std::string` object itself has a fixed size, typically holding just
  some pointers.._[]

* The string content – its "characters" – is stored on the heap in space
  that is automatically allocated as required.

* Very often, for efficiency purposes (if a string gets extended by adding
  characters one after the other to its end) there is some unused extra space
  kept at the end of the payload.

.F[:
E.g. it may use three pointers: to refer to the string's first character, its
last, and the upper limit of the extra space available for extending the string
at its end.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.1
name: std_string_accessor
header: ### Non-modifying `std::string` Functions

There are a few trivial member functions like:

* `empty()` to find out if the string contains any characters at all, or

* `size()` or `length()` to determine how many characters the string contains,

Others are at most moderately complex but not heavily complex, like:

* Searching a string for given characters or patterns …

* … from either end …

* … possibly skipping over already considered parts.

* Accessing parts of a string (single characters or sub-strings).

This is all well documented in many books and online references and usually
causes no problems (beyond the level of general basic C++ programming).

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.1
name: std_string_modifiers
header: ### Modifying `std::string` Functions

The various functions._[] to modify `std::string` range from

* modify a single character, over

* modify a substring, to

* modify the whole string.

.F[:
These functions are also members of the `std::string` class, though for some of
them that design has sometimes been criticised with the argument that only
operations closely related to accessing or modifying the private state of an
object should be members, while for others, especially those that manufacture
and return a new instance – like `std::string::substr` – global functions should
have been preferred.
]

If a string is shortened there usually is no behavioral guarantee, in fact
implementations vary with respect to when and how many of the used space will
be eventually returned (and hence become available for other usages).

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.1
name: std_string_modifiers
header: ### C++ `std::string` vs. C-Style Strings

.N[
What has to be understood and taken into account is the link from `std::string`
to the string representation used in C.
]

* Strings as used in C boil down to a pointer referring to the string's first
  character.

* Furthermore a special termination is expected as part of the string, that is
  the `'\0'`-character, a byte (or word) with all bits cleared.

Because of C compatibility there exists still a number of functions in the
C++ standard library dealing with a C-style string representation which is
always at the risk of becoming invalid when a string's content changes.

---
template: refersto

name: basic_string_template
header: ### C++ template `std::basic_string`

[Code-Points]: http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#code_point
[Code-Units]: http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#code_unit
[UTF16]: http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#UTF_16
[UTF32]: http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#UTF_32

Depending on the character set used and its representation of [Code-Points] as
[Code-Units] there may be different types necessary for storing the single
characters of a string.._[]

.N[
To avoid code duplication C++ implements all string functionality only once for
the template `std::basic_string`.
]

Via `typedef`-s two instantiations are made available in C++98, named

* `std::string` and
* `std::wstring`.

With C++11 more standard string types were added that internally use [UTF16] or
[UTF32], named

* `std::u16string` (underlying character type `char16t`) and
* `std::u32string` (underlying character type `char32_t`).

.F[:
Other template arguments to instantiate the `std::basic_string` class are a 
traits class for the character type used and an allocator.
]

name: boost_tokenizer
header: ## Boost: Tokenizer

[Boost.Tokenizer]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/tokenizer/
[Boost.String_algorithms]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/boost/algorithm/split_idp110108928.html

All Boost additions for improved string processing in C++ build on the standard
string class.

[Boost.Tokenizer] makes string tokenization available, for which a very basic
usage example looks as follows:._[]
```
#include <boost/tokenizer.hpp> 
#include <string> 
#include <iostream> 

int main() { 
    std::string line;
    while (std::getline(std::cin, line)) {
        for (auto w : boost::tokenizer<>(line)) 
            std::cout << w << std::endl;
    }
} 
```

.F[:
To avoid ambiguity it should be noted that Boost actually supplies two variants
of string tokenizers: Shown above is the larger one, and then there is a tiny,
stripped down implementation bundled with [Boost.String_algorithms].
]

template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.2.13
name: cpp11_string_conversions
header: ## C++11: String Conversions

A significant addition were conversions to and from numeric types:

* For the former a number of overloads for the global function `std::to_string`
  were supplied.

* The latter was done with a set of differently named functions, all taking
  either an `std::string` or an `std::wstring` argument.

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.2.13
name: cpp11_num_to_string
header: ### Converting Numeric Values to Strings

The various overloads exist because each type has its own conversion, i.e. there
is no dependence on argument type conversions.

Typical usage fragments might look as follows:
```
int i; unsigned u; unsigned long ul; double d;
auto s1 = std::to_string(i);
auto s2 = std::to_string(u);
auto s3 = std::to_string(ul);
auto s4 = std::to_string(d);
```

.N[
A big advantage compared to `sprintf` or `snprintf` is there are no more buffers
of fixed size involved that might overflow or cause truncation.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.2.13
name: cpp11_string_to_num
header: ### Converting Strings to Numeric Values

[`std::stoi`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stoi
[`std::stoul`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stoul
[`std::stod`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stod

For that purpose individual functions were added carrying the returned type
in their name (some `std::` prefixes omitted for brevity):

  * [`std::stoi`], `…stol`, `…stoll` (returning `int`, `long`, `long long`)
  * [`std::stoul`], `…stoull` (returning `unsigned long`, `unsigned long long`)
  * [`std::stod`], `…stod`, `…stold` (returning `float`, `double`, `long double`))

Typical usage fragments (assuming `std::string s` and `std::size_t p`):
```
… = std::stol(s);     // converts from s to long with base 8,
                      // 10 or 16, automatically determined by
                      // prefix 0, no prefix, or prefix 0x / 0X
… = std::stol(s, &p);    // as before with p holding the index
                         // of the character that stopped the
                         // conversion or std::string::npos
… = std::stol(s, &p, 8);    // as before but always uses base 8
… = std::stol(s, &p, 10);   // ... base 10 ...
… = std::stol(s, &p, 16);   // ... base 16 ...
… = std::stol(s, &p, 36);   // ... up to base 36 (0..9-A..Z)
… = std::stol(s, nullptr, 16); // converts from s with base 16,
                               // stop position not of interest
```

name: boost_lexical_cast
header: ## Boost: Lexical Cast

[Boost.Lexical_cast]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/boost_lexical_cast.html

With [Boost.Lexical_cast] there is a particular elegant solution for converting
between `std::string`-s and numeric types, spelled `lexical_cast`.._[]

* Internally `std::stringstream`-s are used, so it can convert

  * **from** every class or basic type that defines and implements `operator<<`
    as stream insertion,

  * **to** every class or basic type that defines and implements `operator>>` as
    stream extraction.

The basic usage form looks like this (with `std::string s` and `double d`):
```
   s = boost::lexical_cast<std::string>(d);
   d = boost::lexical_cast<double>(s);
```

.F[:
Still better: `boost::lexical_cast`s are not limited to conversions which – at
one end – have an `std::string` involved, but are capable to cross-convert
between anything that adheres to the requirements summarized above.
]

template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 14
name: cpp11_regular_expressions
header: ## C++11: Regular Expressions

With the adoption of regular expressions in C++11 a powerful library component
was made available for:

* Comparing character strings

* Extracting parts from character strings
 
* Modifying character strings

.N[
Developers experienced with regular expressions usually tend to do nearly every
string processing by means of regular expressions.
]

Compared to an equivalent algorithm using low-level string processing
functionality, regular expressions typically

* have much more compact source,

* therefore are better comprehensible and

* hence easier to modify and extend.


---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 14
name: cpplib_regex_defects
header: ### Linux `<regex>` defects warning

.W[
For more than a year after major Linux variants had begun the transition to the
C++11 library implementation, the header file `<regex>` was contained with the
actual implementation code to 99% broken.
]

The effect was that a program with regular expression processing compiled but

* either exposed exceptions at run-time (due to the missing parts in the
  implementation)

* or simply did not do what was expected.

.N[
Luckily the regular expressions component from Boost could – *and still can* –
be used as compatible replacement.._[]
]

.F[:
The difference expresses itself typically only in which header file is included
and from which namespace global names are taken, `std::` or `boost::`.
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples
header: ### Regular Expressions by Example

A short introduction to regular expressions is best given by example.

To try such examples, a simple small main program is fully sufficient:._[]
```
#include <iostream>
#include <regex>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    const string rs{"… (regular expression to try) …"};
    regex rx{rs};
    string line;
    while (getline(std::cin, line)) {
        if (regex_match(line, rx))
            cout << "input matched: " << rs << endl;
        else
            cout << "failed to match: " << rs << endl;
    }
}
```

.F[:
Of course, for any new regular expression to try, the program needs to be
recompiled. To avoid this the program could be rewritten to take the regular
expression (string) from a command line argument.
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_example_intnum
header: #### Regex Example: Integral Numbers

[Raw String Literal]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/string_literal

Recognizing integral numbers with regular expressions is very easy:

* `[0-9]+` says that there should be a digit, optionally repeated but at least
  one.

* `\d+` is basically the same.

* `-?\d+` allows for an optional sign prefixed to the number.

.W[
As a backslash is often part of regular expressions, it must not be forgotten to
quote it (by duplication) if the expression is specified as classic literal.
]

Classic literal:
```
const std::string rs{"-?\\d"};
```

As a [Raw String Literal] as introduced with C++11:
```
const std::string rs{R"(-?\d)"};
```

---
template: plain
name: regex_example_floatnum
header: #### Regex Example: Floating Point Numbers

The following regular expressions describe floating point numbers, starting out
simple and adding feature by feature:

.N[
The dot cannot be used directly below and needs to be quoted, as it would
represent "any character" otherwise.._[]
]

* `\d+[.]\d+` just two dot-separated parts

* `\d*[.]\d+|\d+[.]\d*` digits either before or after the dot optional

* `[-+]?(\d*[.]\d+|\d+[.]\d*)` left hand optional plus or minus sign …

* `[-+]?(\d*[.]\d+|\d+[.]\d*)([eE][-+]?\d+)?` … optional exponent …

* `[-+]?((\d*[.]\d+|\d+[.]\d*)|(\d+[.]?\d*[eE][-+]?\d+))`  
   dot optional if there is an exponent

.F[:
Readers already familiar with regular expressions may ask why the dot wasn't
quoted with a backslash like in: `\d+(\.\d+){3}`. Of course this would have
worked too but the author of this text prefers to quote the dot with a *single
character* character class for better readability.
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_commenting
header: #### Side Note: Commenting Regular Expressions

Experience tells that simple regular expressions are easily comprehensible
after a little training and practicing. With rising complexity explaining the
regular expression structure in comments should be considered:
```
… R"([-+]?((\d+[.]\d*|\d*[.]\d+)|(\d+[.]?\d*[eE][-+]?\d+)))" …
//  :|   |^|~~~~~~| ||| |~~~~~~|^|~~~|     |~~~~|  ||~~~|^:
//  :|   |^|      | ||| |      |^|| ||     || sign ^|   |^:
//  :|   |^|right ^^^|| |      |^|| ||     ||  optional |^:
//  :|   |^|... or --^| |      |^|| ||     |^-exponent-^|^:
//  :|   |^|... left -^^^      |^|| |^^^^^^^-- opt. and |^:

//  :.............. raw string delimiters ................:
// underlining marks mandatory parts of each major component
// ~~~~~~~~~~~       ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~
```

.N[
If it gets even more complicated than this a large regular expression might be
split into parts which are then explained separately.
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples
header: #### Regex Example: IP numbers

An IP number consists of for integral parts separated by dots:

* `\d+[.]\d+[.]\d+[.]\d+` – the straight forward approach

* `\d+([.]\d+){3}` – same with using repetition

Note that the parentheses in the second example will apply the repetition
count `{3}` to the whole parenthesized sequence `[.]\d+`.

* Without (necessary) parentheses the meaning would be different:  
  `\d+[.]\d{3}` is a digit sequence of any length, followed by a dot, followed
  by exactly three more digits.

* On the other hand, parentheses that do not change precedence may be used
  for more clarity,._[]

  *  e.g. `(\d+{1,3})(([.]\d+){1,3}){3}`

  * similar to `(a*b) + (c/d)` in an arithmetic expression.

.F[:
Or rather *in the hope for more clarity*, as too many parentheses also reduce
readability … (but may help to skip over related parts with a parentheses
matching editor).
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples_parentheses
header: #### Side Note: More on Parentheses

The parentheses were used in the last examples to changed precedence of regular
expression operators, which are from highest to lowest:._[]

* optionality and repetition (`?`, `+`, `*`, `{…}`, `{…,…}`)

* concatenation ("invisible" operator)

* alternative (`|`)

.F[:
There are a few more like anchoring at the beginning (`^`) or at the end (`$`)
for which special rules apply as there use is limited to certain places.
]

When extracting parts of a string controlled by regular expressions, parentheses
may also determine the (sub-) sequences of interest.

.N[
There are also purely grouping parentheses, written as `(:?` and `)`. But as
their use tends to make regular expressions slightly less readable they were
avoided in the introductory examples.
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples_grouping
header: #### The Trick to Do Group Separators

[String Literal Concatenation]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_syntax#String_literal_concatenation

Frequently numbers are written by separating digits into groups:

* Currencies often group digits by three, except for the fractional part, which
  typically has exactly two digits (or may be omitted).

* The German way to write telephone numbers (according to the DIN) is to build
  groups of two digits from the right, separated by blanks.._F[]

```
std::regex euro_currency("[1-9]\\d{,2}([.]\\d{3})*(,\\d{2})?");
// first up to three .....|^^^^^^^^^^||         | |        |
// (opt. repeated) groups of three ...|^^^^^^^^^| |        |
// finally (opt.) cents ..........................|^^^^^^^^|

std::regex din_telephone(
//|------- optional ----------------------|
//|        including ONE trailing blank | | 
//|   v-- surrounded by parentheses --v V | 
 "(?:[(]" "0[1-9]?(?: [0-9][0-9])+" "[)] )?" // <-- area code
         "[1-9][0-9]?(?: [0-9][0-9])*"       // <-- local line
);
```

.F[:
That second part of the example uses [String Literal Concatenation] (introduced
with C89 but maybe a lesser known feature of the C++ language) and makes the
regex c'tor argument more stand-out.
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples_whitespace
header: #### The Trick to Do White Space Sequences

Space characters in regular expressions represent themselves,._[] i.e. they
must match exactly the *same amount and kind* of white space.

Regular expressions may be easily bloated with `\s+` or `[ \t]*` if they are
used to match text in which

* sequences of blanks or even any white space (including tab etc.) can be used
  with the same meaning as a single blank, or

* white space may optionally be interspersed at many locations.

.N[
A good solution is to run a [normalization step](#regex_examples_subst) on
a string before checking it against a regular expression:

1. Remove all **optional** white space (and sequences thereof).
2. Where white space is **mandatory** turn sequences of any kind of white space
   into exactly one single blank.
]

.F[:
Some variants of regular expressions allow to take away any meaning from white
space embedded in a regular expression, so that it may be used for structuring.
Where a space characters has to occur literally, `\s` can be used (and `\t` for
tabs etc.).
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples_notperfect
header: #### The Trick NOT Trying It Too Perfect

You might feel tempted to use sequence counts for direct control of digit
sequences, like in the IP number example each components can have no more than
three digits:

* `\d+{1,3}([.]\d{1,3}){3}` allows at most three digits in each part

But this is of course not sufficient to exclude any invalid input, as the
numeric values between dots must not exceed 255. Which problems arise when
overdoing range checks are easily demonstrated in the simple example to
recognize a month in a date as a number between 1 and 12:

* `1[0-2]|[1-9]` for 1, 2, 3 … 12 like in English dates (8/12/2014)

* `1[0-2]|0[1-9]` for 01, 02, … 12 like in ISO dates (2014-08-12)

So anything._[] is possible at the cost of readability … but:

.N[
Often the better approach is to allow any number (maybe with checking for an
upper limit of contained digits) and to postpone more validity tests until
the numeric value is picked up from the string.
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples_access
header: #### Accessing Sub-Patterns

Once some text matches a given regular expression, it is very easy to access
sub-patterns.

At first parentheses need to be placed in the regular expression to mark the
sub-patterns of interest:
```
// start c'tor -+       v----------------------------v
//   arg. list  |       | 1st sub-pattern selection  |
std::regex telno{"(?:[(](0[1-9]?(?: [0-9][0-9])*)[)] )?"
                      "([1-9][0-9]?(?: [0-9][0-9])*)"};
                  //   | 2nd sub-pattern selection | |   end c'tor
                  //   ^---------------------------^ +-- arg. list
```

Then ``std::regex_match`` is called with an additional argument:
```
std::string input;
while (std::getline(std::cin, input)) {

    if (std::regex_match(input, select, telno))
        std::cout << "area code:  " << select[1] << '\n'

header: #### Matching vs. Finding

If in an regular expression there is only a single sub-pattern of interest
instead of `std::regex_match` using `std::regex_search` should be considered:

Assuming an `std::string input` the following
```
std::regex eur_amount("EUR \\d+,\\d{2}");
if (std::regex_search(input, smatch, eur_amount)) …
   … smatch[0] … // access whole match
```

is equivalent to:
```
std::regex eur_amount(".*?(EUR \\d+,\\d{2}).*");
if (std::regex_match(input, smatch, eur_amount)) …
   … smatch[1] … // access first (and only) sub-match
```

.N[
Here the *non-greedy* variant `*?` of the plain repetition operator `*` has been
used, though it only makes a difference if in `input` there are two possible
matches starting with "EUR" each._[]
]

.F[:
Getting accustomed to take care helps to avoid subtle problems like that of
`".*(\\d+).*"` which often come to surprise of regular expression newbies …

template: plain
name: regex_examples_subst
header: #### Doing Substitutions

Regular expressions can also be used to describe what should be substituted
inside a string:._[]
```
std::string s;
… // read an input line into s

// remove leading and trailing white space:
s = std::regex_replace(s, std::regex("^[ \t]+"), ""); 
s = std::regex_replace(s, std::regex("[ \t]+$"), ""); 
// normalize remaining white space to a single blank:
s = std::regex_replace(s, std::regex("[ \t]+"), " "); 
```

The use of `^…` and `…$` in the regular expressions above will *anchor the
patterns* to match only at the beginning or the end respectively.

.N[
Preprocessing to [normalize input](#regex_examples_whitespace) in which white
space sequences are optionally allowed at many places can help to simplify regular
expressions used later for input analysis.
]

.F[:
It is **not** an oversight to use `\t`, not `\\t` despite the classic form of
string literal, as the former gets translated to a tab character which is then
taken literally in the regular expression.

header: #### Reusing Sub-Matches in Substitutions

[ECMA-Script]: http:://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.5.4.1
[POSIX Rules]: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sed.html#tag_20_116_13_03

Substitutions controlled by regular expression become even more powerful as
sub-matches can easily be reused in substitutions.

The following code swaps

* currency names (first sub-pattern matched by `EUR|DKK|GBP|SEK|NOK`)

* with amounts (second sub-pattern matched by `\d+,\d{2}`):._[]
```
std::regex eur_amount("(EUR|DKK|GBP|SEK|NOK) (\\d+,\\d{2})");
…
std::regsub(input, eur_amount, "$2 $1");
```

.F[:
Using double backslashes in the regular expression specification is necessary
because it is specified here as classic C string literal.
]

.N[
The default syntax to refer to matched text is that of [ECMA-Script].
]

Alternatively [POSIX Rules] can be enabled with the flag
`std::regex_constants::format_sed` as fourth argument.

[Boost.Regex]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/regex/doc/html/index.html
[Boost.String_algo]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/string_algo.html

C++11 regular expressions emerged from [Boost.Regex].

Therefore there is little difference:

* Some options and features available from Boost have not been standardized.

* Moreover, Boost regular expression._[] may evolve more rapidly with respect
  of new, experimental features or dialects supported.

.N[
Unless you have a [broken implementation](#cpplib_regex_defects) of regular
expressions the standard implementation is usually sufficient and there is
little need to use Boost regular expressions.
]

.F[:
To avoid ambiguity it should be noted that Boost actually supplies two variants
of regular expressions: The full-blown implementation available as a separate
component (to which this page refers), and a separate, much stripped down
implementation bundled with [Boost.String_algo], the extended string algorithms.

header: ## Boost: Xpressive

[Boost.Xpressive]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/xpressive.html

Processing regular expressions is usually broken into two parts:

* Constructing a state machine (FSM) from what is textually specified.

* Executing that FSM guided by an actual string to compare to an regular
  expression, access parts, etc.

.N[
The separation makes sense because the first part is typically more time
consuming but will need to happen only once, while the second may happen
frequently but executes fast.
]

With C++11 and Boost both parts usually take place at runtime.._[]

.F[:
Of course, any program using regular expressions should be structured to exploit
this separation, shifting the FSM construction out of the loops that actually
match against or otherwise process strings with the regular expression
machinery.
]

[Boost.Xpressive] implements regular expressions with Meta Programming techniques,
effectively shifting the first part from runtime to compile-time.

[Boost.Spirit]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/spirit/doc/html/index.html

Though regular expressions are quite powerful, they have a limit – then more
powerful tools like [Boost.Spirit] enter the scene.

.N[
The abstract grammar fragments shown below – they parse a comma separated
sequence of floating point values inside curly braces and store them in a
sequential container `data` – can very well be just a part of more complex
overall syntax.
]
```
… '{' << ( float_[push_back(ref(data), _1)]
      << *( ',' << float_[push_back(ref(data), _1)]) ) << '}' …
```

Or yet simpler:
```
… '{' << (float_[push_back(phoenix::ref(data), _1)] % ',') << '}' …
```


.F[:
To a certain degree this may be overcome by combining regular expressions with other
string processing facilities, but on the long run switching to superior tools and
techniques is advisable.
