template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.1
name: std_string_recap
header: ## Standard Strings (Recap)

The class `std::string` was introduced in its current form with C++98.
while C++11 extended it in a number of ways it left the basic design unchanged:

* The `std::string` object itself has a fixed size, typically holding just
  some pointers.._[]

* The string content - its "characters" - is stored on the heap in space
  that is automatically allocated as required.

* Very often, for efficiency purposes if a string gets extended by adding
  characters one after the other to its end, there is some unused extra
  space kept at the end of the payload.

.F[:
E.g. it may use three pointers: to refer to the string's first character, its
last, and the upper limit of the extra space available for extending the string
at its end.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.1
name: std_string_accessor
header: ### Non-modifying `std::string` Functions

There are a few trivial functions like:

* `empty()` to find out if the string contains any characters at all, or

* `size()` or `length()` to determine how many characters the string contains,

Others are at most moderately complex but not heavily complex, like:

* Searching a string for given characters or patterns ...

* ... from either end ...

* ... possibly skipping over already considered parts.

* Accessing parts of a string (single characters or sub-strings).

This is all well documented in many books and online references and usually
causes no problems (beyond the level of general C++ programming).

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.1
name: std_string_modifiers
header: ### Modifying `std::string` Functions

The various functions to modify `std::string` range from

* modify a single character, over

* modify a substring, to

* modify the whole string.

If a string is shortened there ususally is no behavioral guarantee, in fact
implementations vary with respect to when and how many of the used space will
be eventually returned (and hence become available for other usages).

template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.1
name: std_string_modifiers
header: ### C++ `std::string` vs. C-Style Strings

.N[
What has to be understood and taken into account is the link from `std::string`
to the string representation used in C.
]

Strings as used in C boil down to a pointer referring to the string's first
character. Furthermore a special termination is expected as part of the string,
that is, the '\0' character, a byte (or word) with all bits cleared.

Because of C compatibility there exist still a number of functions in the
C++ standard library dealing with a C-style string representation which is
always at the risk of becomming invalid when a string's content changes.

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.1
name: basic_string_template
header: ### C++ template `std::basic_string`

Depending on the character set used and its stored representation there may be
different types necessary for storing the single characters of a string.._[]

To avoid code duplication C++ implements all string functionality only once for
the template `std::basic_string` - via `typedef`-s - making two instantiations
available in C++98 with the names `std::string` and `std::wstring`.

With C++11 more standard string types were added that internally use UTF16 or
UTF32, named `std::u16string` and `std::u32string`, with the underlying character
type `char16_t` and `char32_t`.

.F[:
Other template arguments to instantiate the `std::basic_string` class are a 
traits class for the character type used and an allocator
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Schäling: 5.5
name: boost_tokenizer
header: ## Boost: Tokenizer

All Boost additions for improved string processing in C++ build on the standard
string class.

Boost.Tokenizer makes string tokenization available, for which a very basic usage
example looks as follows:
```
#include <boost/tokenizer.hpp> 
#include <string> 
#include <iostream> 

int main() { 
    std::string line;
    while (std::getline(std::cin, line)) {
        for (auto w : boost::tokenizer<>(line)) 
            std::cout << w << std::endl;
    }
} 
```

.F[:
To avoid ambiguity it should be noted that Boost acctually supplies two variants
of string tokenizer implementationss: The "official" component (the larger one
to which this slide refers), and a separate, stripped down implementation bundled
with its extended string algorithms.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.2.13
name: cpp11_string_conversions
header: ## C++11: String Conversions

A significant addition were conversions between to and from numeric types:

* For the former a number of overloads for the global function `std::to_string`
  were supplied.

* The latter was done with a set of differently named functions, all taking either
  a `std::string` or `std::wstring` argument.

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.2.13
name: cpp11_num_to_string
header: ### Converting Numeric Values to Strings

The various overloads exist because each type has its own conversion, i.e. there
is no dependance on argument type conversions.

Typical usage fragments might look as follows:
```
int i; unsigned u; unsigned long ul; double d;
auto s1 = std::to_string(i);
auto s2 = std::to_string(u);
auto s3 = std::to_string(ul);
auto s4 = std::to_string(d);
```

.N[
A big advantage compred to `sprintf` or `snprintf` is there are no more buffers
of fixed size involved that might overflow or cause truncation.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 13.2.13
name: cpp11_string_to_num
header: ### Converting Strings to Numeric Values

For that purpose individual functions were added carrying the returned type
in their name:

  * `std::stoi` (returning `int`)
  * `std::stol` (returning `long`)
  * `std::stoll` (returning `long long`)
  * `std::stod` (returning `double`)
  * ...

Typical usage fragments (assuming `std::string s` and `std::size_t p`):
```
… = std::stol(s);             // converts from s with base 10

… = std::stol(s, &p);         // as before with p holding index of
                              // character that stopped the
                              // conversion

… = std::stol(s, &p, 8);      // as before but converts with base 8

… = std::stol(s, nullptr, 0); // converts from s with the base
                              // determined automatically (e.g.
                              // base 16 for prefix 0x or 0X)
```

---
template: refersto
see_also: BoostBook: lexical_cast
name: boost_lexical_cast
header: ## Boost: Lexical Cast

The Boost library offers a particular elegant solution for converting between
strings and numeric types, called `lexical_cast`.._[]

* Internally `std::stringstream`-s are used, so it can convert

  * **from** every class or basic type that defines and implements
    `operator<<` as stream insertion,

  * **to** every class or basic type that defines and implements
   `operator>>` as stream extraction.

The basic usage form looks like this (with `std::string s` and `double d`):
```
   s = boost::lexical_cast<std::string>(d);
   d = boost::lexical_cast<double>(s);
```

.F[:
Still better: `lexical_cast`s are not even limited to conversions which - at one
end - have an `std::string` involved but are capable to cross-convert between
anything that adhers to the requirements summarized above.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 14
name: cpp11_regular_expressions
header: ## C++11: Regular Expressions

With the adoption of regular expressions in C++11 a powerful library component
was made avalailable for:

* Comparing character strings

* Extracting parts from character strings
 
* Modifying character strings

.N[
Developers experienced with regular expressions usually tend to do nearly every
string processing by means of regular expressions.
]

It is much more compact source, therefore better comprehensible and easier to
modify and extend like an equivalent algorithm using low-level string processing
features.

template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 14
name: cpplib_regex_defects
header: ### Linux `<regex>` defects warning

.W[
For more than a year after major Linux variants had begun the transition to the C++11
library implementation, the header file `<regex>` was contained but the actual
implementation code to 99% broken.
]

The effect was that a program with regular expression processing compiled but

* either exposed exceptions at run-time (due to the missing parts in the implementation)

* or simply did not do what was expected.

.N[
Luckily the regular expressions component from Boost could - *and still can* - be used
as compatible replacement.._[]
]

.F[
The difference expreses itself typically only in which header file is included and from
which namespace global names are taken, `std::` or `boost::`.
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples
header: ### Regular Expressions by Example

A short introduction to regular expressions is best given by example.

To try such examples, a simple small main programm is fully sufficient:._[]

```
#include <iostream>
#include <regex>
#include <string>

int main() {
    using namespace std;
    const string rs{"… (regular expression to try) …"};
    regex rx{rs};
    string line;
    while (getline(std::cin, line)) {
        if (regex_match(line, rx))
            cout << "input matched: " << rs << endl;
        else
            cout << "failed to match: " << rs << endl;
    }
}
```

.F[:
Of course, for any new regular expression to try the program needs to be recompiled.
To avoid this it could be considered to take the regular expression from a command
line argument.
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_example_intnum
header: #### Regex Example: Integral Numbers

Recognizing integral numbers with regular expressions is very easy:

* `[0-9]+` says that there should be a digit, optionally repeated but at least one.

* `\d+` is basically the same.

* `-?\d+` allows for an optional sign prefixed to the number.

.W[
As a backslash is often part of regular expressions, it must not be forgotten to
quote it (by duplication) if the expression is specfied as classic literal.
]

Classic literal:
```
const std::string rs{"-?\\d"};
```

A *raw string literal* as introduced with C++11:
```
const std::string rs{R"(-?\d)"};
```

---
template: plain
name: regex_example_floatnum
header: #### Regex Example: Integral Numbers

The following regular expressions describe floating point numbers, starting out
simple and adding feature by feature:

.N[
The dot cannot be used directly below and needs to be quoted, as it would
represent "any character" otherwise.._[]
]

* `\d+[.]\d+` just two dot-separated parts

* `\d*[.]\d+|\d+[.]\d*` digits either before or after the dot optional

* `[-+]?(\d*[.]\d+|\d+[.]\d*)` left hand optional plus or minus sign ...

* `[-+]?(\d*[.]\d+|\d+[.]\d*)([eE][-+]\d+)?` ... optional exponent ...

* `[-+]?((\d*[.]\d+|\d+[.]\d*)|(\d+[.]?\d*[eE][-+]\d+))`  
   dot optional if there is an exponent

.F[:
Readers already familiar with regular expressions may ask why the dot
wasn't quoted with a backslash: `\d+(\.\d+){3}`
Of course this would have worked two but the author of this text prefers
to quote with "single character character classes" wherever possible for
better readability.
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_commenting
header: #### Sidenote: Commenting Regular Expressions

Experience tells that simple regular expressions are easily comprehensible
after a little training and practicing. With rising complexity explaining the
regular expression structure in comments should be considered:
```
… R"([-+]?((\d+[.]\d*|\d*[.]\d+)|(\d+[.]?\d*[eE][-+]?\d+)))" …
//  :|   |^|~~~~~~| ||| |~~~~~~|^|~~~|     |~~~~|  ||~~~|^:
//  :|   |^|      | ||| |      |^|| ||     || sign ^|   |^:
//  :|   |^|right ^^^|| |      |^|| ||     ||  optional |^:
//  :|   |^|... or --^| |      |^|| ||     |^-exponent-^|^:
//  :|   |^|... left -^^^      |^|| |^^^^^^^-- opt. and  |^:
//  :|   |||... opt. digits    |||^^^- mandatory digits ||:
//  :|   ||\___ no exponent ___/|\___ with exponent ____/|:
//  :|   |+----<< alternative major components >>--------+:
//  :^^^^^-- optional sign                                :
//  :.............. raw string delimiters ................:
// underlining marks mandatory parts of each major component
// ~~~~~~~~~~~       ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~
```

.N[
If it gets even more complicated than this a large regular expression
might be split into parts which are then explained separately.
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples
header: #### Regex Example: IP numbers

An IP number consists of for integral parts separated by dots:

* `\d+[.]\d+[.]\d+[.]\d+` the straight forward approach.

* `\d+([.]\d+){3}` using repetition

Note that the parentheses in the second example will apply the repetition
`{3}` count to the whole parenthized sequence `[.]\d+`.

* Without (necessary) parentheses the meaning would change:  
  `\d+[.]\d{3}` is a digit sequence of any length, followed by a dot, followed
  by exactly three more digits.

* On the other hand, parentheses that do not change precedence may be used
  written for more clarity,._[]

  *  e.g. `(\d+{1,3})(([.]\d+{1,3})){3}`

  * similar to `(a*b) + (c/d)` in an arithmetic expression.

.F[:
Or, maybe, rather *in the hope for more clarity*, as too many parentheses also
reduce readability ... (but may help to skip over related parts in a parentheses
matching editor).
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples_parentheses
header: #### Sidenote: More on Parentheses

The parentheses were used in the last examples to changed precedence or
regular expression operators, which are from highest to lowest:._[]

* optionality and repetition (`?`, `+`, `*`, `{…}`, `{…,…}`)

* concatenation ("invisible" operator)

* alternative (`|`)

When extracting parts of a string controlled by regular expressions, round
parentheses may also determine the (sub-) sequences of interrest.

.N[
There are also purely grouping parentheses, written as `(:?` and `)`. But as
their use tends to make regular expressions slightly less readable they were
avoided for the moment.
]

.F[:
There are a few more like anchoring at the beginning (`^`) or at the end (`$`)
for which special rules apply as there use is limited to certain places.
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples_grouping
header: #### The Trick to do Group Separators

Frequently numbers are written by separating digits into groups:

* Currencies often group digits by three, except for the fractional part,
  which - if it exists - typically has exactly two digits.

* German way to write telephone numbers (according to the DIN) is to
  build groups of two digtis from the right, separated by blanks.

Here is the trick to do both:
```
std::regex euro_currency("[1-9]\\d{,2}([.]\\d{3})*(,\\d{2})?");
// first up to three .....|^^^^^^^^^^||         | |        |
// (opt. repeated) groups of three ...|^^^^^^^^^| |        |
// finally (opt.) cents ..........................|^^^^^^^^|

std::regex din_telephone(
//|------- optional -------------------------|
//|        including ONE trailing blank ---| |
//|   v--- surrounded by parentheses ----v V | 
 "(?:[(]" "(0|0[1-9])(?: [0-9][0-9])*" "[)] )?" // <-- area code
         "[1-9][0-9]?(?: [0-9][0-9])*"          // <-- local line
);
```

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples_whitespace
header: #### The Trick to do White Space Sequences

.N[
Space characters in regular expressions represent themselves,._[] i.e. they
must match exactly the *same amount and kind* of white space.
]

Regular expressions may be easily bloated with `\s+` or `[ \t]*` if they are
used to match text where

* sequences of blanks or even any white space (including tab etc.) can be used
  with the same meaning as a single blank, or

* white space may optionally be interspersed at many locations.

A good solution is to run a [normalization step](#regex_examples_subst)
before checking against a regular expressions:

1. Remove **all optional** white space (and sequences thereof).

2. Where white space is **mandatory** turn sequences into a single blank.

.F[:
Some variants of regular expressions allow to take away any meaning from white
space embedded in a regular expression, so it may be used for structuring.
Where a space characters has to occur literally, `\s` can be used (and `\t`
for tabs etc.)
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples_notperfect
header: #### The Trick NOT Trying It Too Perfect

You might feel tempted to use sequence counts for direct control of digit
sequences, like in the IP number example each components can have no
more than three digits:

* `\d+{1,3}([.]\d{1,3}){3}` allows at most three digits in each part

But this is of course not sufficient to exclude any invalid input, as
the numbers between dots must not exceed 255. Which problems arise when
overdoing range checks are easily demonstrate in the simple example to
recognizing a month in a date as a number between 1 and 12:

* `1[0-2]|[1-9]` for 1, 2, 3 … 12 like in english dates (8/12/2014)

* `(1[0-2]|0[1-9])` for 01, 02, … 12 like in ISO-Dates (2014-08-12)

So anything._[] is possible at the cost of readability ... but:

.N[
Usually the better approach is just to allow any number, maybe with checking
only for an upper limit of contained digits, and to postpone more value
checking until the numbers are picked up from the string
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples_access
header: #### Accessing Sub-Patterns

Once some text matches a given regular expression, it is very easy to access
sub-patterns.

At first parentheses need to be placed in the regular expression to mark
the sub-patterns of interrest:
```
// start c'tor -+       v--------------------------v
//   arg. list  |       | 1st sub-pattern selection|
std::regex telno{"(?:[(]((0|0[1-9])(?: [0-9][0-9])*)[)] )?"
                      "([1-9][0-9]?(?: [0-9][0-9])*)"};
                  //   | 2nd sub-pattern selection | |   end c'tor
                  //   ^---------------------------^ +-- arg. list
```

Then ``std::regex_match`` is called with an additional argument:
```
std::string input;
while (std::getline(std::cin, input)) {
    std::smatch select;
    if (std::regex_match(input, select, telno))
        std::cout << "area code:  " << select[1] << '\n'
                  << "local line: " << select[2] << '\n';
}
```

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples_access
header: #### Matching vs. Finding

If in an regular expression there is only a single sub-pattern of interrest
instead of `std::regex_match` using `std::regex_find` should be considered:

Assuming an `std::string input` the following
```
std::regex eur_amount("EUR \\d+,\\d{2}");
if (std::regex_find(input, smatch, eur_amount)) …
   … smatch[0] … // access whole match
```

is equivalent to:
```
std::regex eur_amount(".*?(EUR \\d+,\\d{2}).*");
if (std::regex_match(input, smatch, eur_amount)) …
   … smatch[1] … // access first (and only) sub-match
```

.N[
Here the *non-greedy* variant `*?` of the plain repetition operator `*` has
been used, though it only makes a difference if there are two possible matches
starting with "EUR" each in `input`.._[]
]

.F[:
Getting accustomed to take care helps to avoid subtle problems like that of
`".*(\\d+).*"` which often come to suprise of regular expression newbies ...
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples_subst
header: #### Doing Substitions

Regular expressions can also be used to describe what should be substituted
inside a string:
```
std::string s;
… // read an input line into s

// remove leading and trailing white space:
s = std::regex_replace(s, std::regex("^[ \t]+", "")); 
s = std::regex_replace(s, std::regex("[ \t]+$", "")); 

// normalize remaining white space to a single blank:
s = std::regex_replace(s, std::regex("[ \t]+", " ")); 
```

The use of `^…` and `…$` in the regular expressions above will *anchor the
patterns* to match only at the beginning or the end respectively.

.N[
Preprocessing to [normalize input](#regex_examples_whitespace) in which white
space sequences are optionally allowed at many places can help to simplify regular
expressions used later for input analysis.
]

---
template: plain
name: regex_examples_subst_reuse
header: #### Reuising Sub-Matches in Substitions

Substitutions controlled by regular expression become even more powerful as
sub-matches can easily be reused in substitutions.

The following code swaps

* currency names (first sub-pattern matched by `EUR|DKK|GBP|SEK|NOK`)

* with amounts (second sub-pattern matched by `\d+,\d{2}:._[]
```
std::regex eur_amount("(EUR|DKK|GBP|SEK|NOK) (\\d+,\\d{2})");
…
std::regsub(input, eur_amount, "$2 $1");
```

.N[
The default syntax to refer to matched text is that of [ECMA-Script].
]

Alternatively [POSIX Rules] can be enabled with the flag
`std::regex_constants::format_sed` as fourth argument.

  [ECMA-Script]: http:://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.5.4.11
  [POSIX Rules]: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sed.html#tag_20_116_13_03

.F[:
Using double backslashes in the regular expression specification is necessary
because it is specified here as classic C string literal.

template: refersto
see_also: Schäling 5.4
name: boost_regular_expressions
header: ## Boost: Regular Expressions

C++11 regular expressions emerged from Boost.

Therefore there is little difference:

* Some options and features available from Boost have not been standardized.

* Moreover, Boost regular expression._[] may evolve more rapidly with respect
  of new, experimental features or dialects supported.

.N[
Unless you have a [broken implenentation](#cpplib_regex_defects) of regular expressions
the standard implementation is usually sufficient and there is little need to use Boost
regular expressions.
]

.F[:
To avoid ambiguity it should be noted that Boost acctually supplies two variants
of regular expression implementation: The full-blown implementation available as
a separate component (to which this page refers), and a separate stripped down
implementation bundled with the extended string algorithms available through Boost.

Processing regular expressions is usually broken into two parts:

* Constructing a state machine (FSM) from what is textually specified.

* Executing that FSM guided by an actual string to compare to an regular
  expression, access parts, etc.

.N[
The separation makes sense because the first part is typically more time
consuming but will need to happen only once, while the second may happen
frequently but excecutes fast.
]

With C++11 and Boost both parts usually take place at runtime.._[]

Boost Xpressive implements regular expressions with Meta Programming techniques,
effectively shifting the first part from runtime to compile-time.

.F[:
Of course, any program using regular expressions should be structured to exploit
this separation, shifting the FSM construction out of the loops that actually
match against or otherwise process strings with the regular expression machinery.

Though regular expressions are quite powerful, they have a limit - then more
powerful tools like [Boost.Spirit] enter the scene.

.N[
The abstract grammar fragments shown below - they parse a comma separated
sequence of floating point values inside curly braces and store them in a
sequential container `data` - can very well be just a part of more complex
overall syntax.
]
```
… '{' << ( float_[push_back(ref(data), _1)]
      << *( ',' << float_[push_back(ref(data), _1)]) ) << '}' …
```

Or yet simpler:
```
… '{' << (float_[push_back(phoenix::ref(data), _1)] % ',') << '}' …
```

.F[:
To a certain degree this may be overcome by combining regular expressions with other
string processing facilities, but on the long run switching to superior tools and
techniques is advisable.
