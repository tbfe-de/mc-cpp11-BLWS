template: refersto
see_also: BoostBook: core
name: checked_delete
header: ### Checked Delete

[Boost.Checked_delete]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/utility/checked_delete.html

[Boost.Checked_delete] is a small helper that should be preferred over plain
`delete` whenever an object of some (base) class is deleted with a virtual
destructor.

.W[
The problem is this: built-in `delete` works with a pointer and therefore it is
sufficient that only a forward declaration of a class is visible, when one of
its objects is deleted. But of course, if the class had a virtual destructor,
then `delete` wouldn't know about it.
]

With `boost::checked_delete` a syntactical context is created that fails to compile
if the full class definition is not visible.

see_also: BoostBook: identity_type
name: identity_type
header: ### Identity Type

[Boost.Identity_type]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/utility/identity_type/doc/html/index.html

[Boost.Identity_type] allows to wrap types within round parenthesis so they can always
be passed as parameters to preprocessor macros.

---

see_also: BoostBook: base_from_member
name: base_from_member
header: ### Base from Member

[Boost.base_from_member]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/utility/base_from_member.html
[Base From Member]: http://www.josuttis.com/cppcode/ronsmember.html 

[Boost.base_from_member] helps to implement the C++ [Base From Member] idiom, to
initialize a base class from some other class member.

As this is not possible with the normal initialization order, the (former) member is
implemented as a (private) base class and listed left of the (public) base class that
needs it for its own initialization.

template: refersto
see_also: BoostBook: tribool
name: tribool
header: ### Tribool

[Boost.Tribool]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/tribool.html

[Boost.Tribool] implements a *three state logical* type adding `indeterminate`
to `true` and `false`. Operators `&&`, `||`, and `!` `==` and `!=` are changed
accordingly, so if some `boost::tribool t` that happens to be `indeterminate`
is part of a (boolean) expression,

* either the outcome is still `indeterminate`, like

  * in `t || false`

  * or `t && true`,

* or it may not have any influence, like

  * in `t && false`

 * or `t || true`.

Note that whenever some `indeterminate` value is negated, its truth value is
still indeterminate!

]

---
template: refersto
see_also: BoostBook: log
name: logging
header: ### Logging

[Boost.Log]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/log/doc/html/index.html

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Log] aims to make logging significantly easier for the application
developer. It provides a wide range of out-of-the-box tools along with public
interfaces for extending the library. The main goals of the library are:

* Simplicity. A small example code snippet should be enough to get the feel of
  the library and be ready to use its basic features.

* Extensibility. A user should be able to extend functionality of the library
  for collecting and storing information into logs.

* Performance. The library should have as little performance impact on the
  user's application as possible.

[Boost.Flyweight]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/flyweight/doc/index.html

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
Flyweights are small-sized handle classes granting constant access to shared
common data, thus allowing for the management of large amounts of entities
within reasonable memory limits. [Boost.Flyweight] makes it easy to use this
common programming idiom by providing the class template `flyweight<T>`, which
acts as a drop-in replacement for const T.

[Boost.Signal]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/signals.html

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
The [Boost.Signal] Library is an implementation of a managed signals and slots
system. Signals represent callbacks with multiple targets, and are also called
publishers or events in similar systems. Signals are connected to some set of
slots, which are callback receivers (also called event targets or subscribers),
which are called when the signal is "emitted."

header: ### CRC

[Boost.CRC]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/crc/

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.CRC] provides two implementations of CRC (cyclic redundancy code)
computation objects and two implementations of CRC computation functions.
The implementations are template-based.

* The first object implementation is for theoretical use. It can process single
  bits, but is considered slow for practical use.

* The second object implementation is byte-oriented and uses look-up tables for
  fast operation. The optimized implementation should be suitable for general
  use.

* The first function implementation uses the optimized object.

* The second function implementation allows the use of a CRC that directly
  follows its data.

header: ### More String Algorithms

[Boost.String_algo]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/string_algo.html

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
The [Boost.String_algo] Library provides a generic implementation of
string-related algorithms which are missing in STL. It is an extension to the
algorithms library of STL and it includes trimming, case conversion, predicates
and find/replace functions. All of them come in different variants so it is
easier to choose the best fit for a particular need.

[Boost.Algorithm]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/algorithm/doc/html/index.html

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Algorithm] is a collection of general purpose algorithms. While Boost
contains many libraries of data structures, there is no single library for
general purpose algorithms. Even though the algorithms are generally useful,
many tend to be thought of as "too small" for Boost.

[Boost.Dynamic_bitset]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/dynamic_bitset/dynamic_bitset.html

[Boost.Dynamic_bitset] is for those who do not like the `std::vector<bool>`.

.F[:
Replacing the `std::vector<bool>` specialisation with `std::bitvector` seems
also to be considered for C++17.
]

template: refersto
see_also: BoostBook: circular_buffer
name: circular_buffer
header: ### Circular Buffer

[Boost.Circular_Buffer]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/circular_buffer.html

[Boost.Circular_Buffer] provides a fixed-size data structure suitable for queues.._[]

It works by advancing two pointers or indeces over the space available for contained
elements, one for reading and one for writing. Presumably the read-position follows
behind the write position (given filling into and taking from the data structure occur
in a mix.

When the end of the available space is reached, the pointers wrap-around, reusing the
slots from the front. And of course there are mechanisms to detect (and handle)

* overflow (i.w. no more space as write position is directly behind read position) and

* underflow (i.e. read position has caught-up with current write position).

.F[:
More recent versions have been extended by an alternative data structure that can grow
at runtime, if necessary.

[Boost.Heap]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/heap.html

[Boost.Heap] provides priority queues, which – in comparison to the `std::queue adapter`
implements more functionality and different performance characteristics.

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
Especially, it deals with additional aspects:

* **Mutability**: The priority of heap elements can be modified.
* **Iterators**: Heaps provide iterators to iterate all elements.
* **Mergeable**: While all heaps can be merged, some can be merged efficiently.
* **Stability**: Heaps can be configured to be stable sorted.
* **Comparison**: Heaps can be compared for equivalence.

[Boost.Multi_index]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Multi_index] enables the construction of containers maintaining one or more indices
with different sorting and access semantics. It interfaces similar to STL containers.
The concept is borrowed from relational database terminology and allows complex data
structures in the spirit of multiply indexed relational tables where simple sets and maps
are not enough.

[Boost.Multi_array]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/multi_array/doc/user.html

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Multi_array] provides a class template and semantically equivalent adaptors for
arrays of contiguous data. It is a more efficient and convenient way to express N-dimensional
arrays than, especially in comparison to the `std::vector<std::vector<…>>` formulation of
N-dimensional arrays. Additional features, such as resizing, reshaping, and creating views
are also available.

[Boost.Intrusive]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/intrusive.html

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
Intrusive containers offer better performance and exception safety guarantees than
non-intrusive containers (like STL containers). Their performance benefits make them
ideal as a building block to efficiently construct complex containers like multi-index
containers or to design high performance code like memory allocation algorithms.

data, commonly referred to as tuples. A set of containers (vector, list, set and
map) is provided, along with views that provide a transformed presentation of
their underlying data.

C++11 has adopted._[] the [Boost.Ratio](#ratio) library (for more information see next page).

.F[
The C++11 `<chrono>` library uses compile-time rational numbers to implement durations
with different resolutions, and also makes use of the (compile time) operations specified
here when it has to choose the "common" type necessary for "loss-less" representation of
the result, when different resolutions are combined in an operation.

[Boost.Type_traits]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/type_traits/doc/html/index.html

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Type_traits] contains a set of specific traits classes, each of which **encapsulates a
single trait** from the C++ type system, e.g.:

* Is a type a pointer or a reference type?
* Is a type `const`-qualified?
* Does it have a trivial constructor?

Furthermore it contains a set of classes to **perform transformations** on a type, e.g:

* Remove a top-level `const` or `volatile´ qualifier from a type.

header: ### Boost: Call Traits

[Boost.Call_traits]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/utility/call_traits.htm

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Call_traits] provide a template (to be used as compile time function) that
encapsulates specifying the best method to pass a parameter of some type `T` to or
from a function. Its main purpose and that parameters are passed in the most efficient#
manner possible._[]
]

.F[
Prior to C++11 which has changed the rules in this respect another purpose was to ensure
syntax errors caused by problems like *references to references* will be circumvented.

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Enable_if] provides templates by which a function or class template
specialization **can to include or exclude itself** from a set of matching
functions or specializations, based on properties of its template arguments.

E.g. one can define function templates that are only enabled for an arbitrary set of
types defined by a traits class.

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Preprocessor] provides macros to support preprocessor meta-programming.
Both C++ and C compilation and the library does not depend on any other parts of
Boost and therefore may be used as a standalone library.
