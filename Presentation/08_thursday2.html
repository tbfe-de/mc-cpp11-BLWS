name: checked_delete
header: ### Checked Delete

[Boost.Checked_delete]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/utility/checked_delete.html

[Boost.Checked_delete] is a small helper that should be prefered over plain `delete`
whenever an object of some (base) class is deleted with a virtual destructor.

.W[
The problem is this: builtin `delete` works with a pointer and therefore it is
sufficient that only a forward declaration of a class is visible, when one of
its objects is deleted. But of course, if the class had a virtual destructor,
then `delete` wouldn't know about it.
]

With `boost::checked_delete` a syntactical context is created that fails to compile
if the full class definition is not visible.

see_also: BoostBook: identity_type
name: identity_type
header: ### Identity Type

[Boost.Identity_type]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/utility/identity_type/doc/html/index.html

[Boost.Identity_type] allows to wrap types within round parenthesis so they can always
be passed as parameters to preprocessor macros.

[Boost.base_from_member]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/utility/base_from_member.html
[Base From Member]: http://www.josuttis.com/cppcode/ronsmember.html 

[Boost.base_from_member] helps to implement the C++ [Base From Member] idiom, to
initialize a base class from some other class member.

As this is not possible with the normal initialization order, the (former) member is
implemented as a (private) base class and listed left of the (public) base class that
needs it for its own to initialization.

see_also: BoostBook: tribool
name: tribool
header: ### Tribool

[Boost.Tribool]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/tribool.html

[Boost.Tribool] implements a *three state logical* type adding `indeterminate`
to `true` and `false`. Operators `&&`, `||`, and `!` `==` and `!=` are changed
accordingly, so if some `boost::tribool t` that happens to be `indeterminate`
is part of a (boolean) expression,

* either the outcome is still `indeterminate`, like

  * in `t || false`

  * or `t && true`,

* or it may not have any influence, like

  * in `t && false`

 * or `t || true`.

Note that whenever some `indeterminate` value is negated, its truth value is
still indeterminate!

template: refersto

name: circular_buffer
header: ### Circular Buffer

[Boost.Circular_Buffer]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/circular_buffer.html

[Boost.Circular_Buffer] provides a fixed-size data structure suitable for queues._[]

It works by advancing two pointers or indeces over the space available for contained
elements, one for reading and one for writing. Presumably the read-position follows
behind the write position (given filling into and taking from the data structure occur
in a mix.

When the end of the available space is reached, the pointers wrap-around, reusing the
slots an the front. And of course there are mechanisms to detect (and handle)

* overflow (i.w. no more space as write position is directly behind read position) and

* underflow (i.e. read position has caught-up with current write position).

.[
More recent versions have been extended by an alternative data structure that can grow
at runtime, if necessary.
]

template: refersto
see_also: BoostBook: heap
name: heap
header: ### Heap

[Boost.Heap]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/heap.html

[Boost.Heap] provides priority queues, which - in comparison to the `std::queue adapter`
implements more functionality and different performance characteristics.

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
Especially, it deals with additional aspects:

* **Mutability**: The priority of heap elements can be modified.
* **Iterators**: Heaps provide iterators to iterate all elements.
* **Mergable**: While all heaps can be merged, some can be merged efficiently.
* **Stability**: Heaps can be configured to be stable sorted.
* **Comparison**: Heaps can be compared for equivalence.

name: multi_index
header: ### Multi-Index

[Boost.Multi_index]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/multi_index/doc/index.html

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Multi_index] enables the construction of containers maintaining one or more indices
with different sorting and access semantics. It interfaces similar to STL containers.
The concept is borrowed from relational database terminology and allows complex data
structures in the spirit of multiply indexed relational tables where simple sets and maps
are not enough.

see_also: BoostBook: multi_array
name: multi_array
header: ### Multi-Array

[Boost.Multi_array]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/multi_array/doc/user.html

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Multi_array] provides a class template and semantically equivalent adaptors for
arrays of contiguous data. It is a more efficient and convenient way to express N-dimensional
arrays than, especially in comparison to the `std::vector<std::vector<...>>` formulation of
N-dimensional arrays. Additional features, such as resizing, reshaping, and creating views
are also available.

name: intrusive_containers
header: ### Intrusive Containers

[Boost.Intrusive]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/intrusive.html

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
Intrusive containers offer better performance and exception safety guarantees than
non-intrusive containers (like STL containers). Their performance benefits make them
ideal as a building block to efficiently construct complex containers like multi-index
containers or to design high performance code like memory allocation algorithms.

name: fusion
header: ### Fusion

[Boost.Fusion]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/fusion/doc/html/

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Fusion]._[] is a library for working with heterogenous collections of data,
commonly referred to as tuples. A set of containers (vector, list, set and map) is
provided, along with views that provide a transformed presentation of their underlying
data.
]

.F[
It is named "fusion" because it is a "fusion" of compile time metaprogramming with
runtime programming.

header: ### Motivation

[Compile Time Meta Programming]: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Templates/Template_Meta-Programming

As a motivation for the benefits of [Compile Time Meta Programming] two
other Boost libraries are presented first, a small one and a large one.

These should be only taken as examples, as many more Boost libraries exploit
meta-progamming techniques.

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Swap] provides the template function `boost::swap` that exchanges the values in
two variables, using argument dependent lookup [ADL] to select a specialized swap function
if available. If no specialized swap function is available, `std::swap` is used.

header: ### C++11: Ratio

C++11 has adopted._[] the [Boost.Ratio](#ratio) library (for more information see next page).

.F[
The C++11 `<chrono>` library uses compile-time rational numbers to implement durations
with different resolutions, and also makes use of the (compile time) operations specified
here when it has to choose the "common" type necessary for "loss-less" representation of
the result, when different resolutions are combined in an operation.

.N[
[Boost.Ratio] allows to specifying compile time rational constants such as
1/3 of a nanosecond or the number of inches per meter. It represents a
compile time ratio of compile time constants with support for compile time
arithmetic with overflow and division by zero protection.

[Boost.Type_traits]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/type_traits/doc/html/index.html

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Type_traits] contains a set of specific traits classes, each of which **encapsulates a
single trait** from the C++ type system, e.g.:

* Is a type a pointer or a reference type?
* Is a type `const`-qualified?
* Does it have a trivial constructor?

Furthermore it contains a set of classes to **perform transformations** on a type, e.g:

* Remove a top-level `const` or `volatile´ qualifier from a type.

header: ### Boost: Call Traits

[Boost.Call_traits]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/utility/call_traits.htm

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Call_traits] provide a template (to be used as compile time function) that
encapsulates specifying the best method to pass a parameter of some type `T` to or
from a function. Its main purpose and that parameters are passed in the most efficient#
manner possible._[]
]

.F[
Prior to C++11 which has changed the rules in this respect another purpose was to ensure
syntax errors caused by problems like *references to references* will be circumvented.

[Boost.Enable_if]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_56_0/libs/core/doc/html/core/enable_if.html

From the Boost Documentation:
.N[
[Boost.Enable_if] provides templates by which a function or class template specialization
**can to include or exclude itself** from a set of matching functions or specializations,
based on properties of its template arguments.

E.g. one can define function templates that are only enabled for an arbitrary set of
types defined by a traits class.
