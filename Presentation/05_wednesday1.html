template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 5.2.1
name: cpp11_shared_ptr
header: ## C++11: `std::shared_ptr`

With `std::shared_ptr` C++11 introduced a *Smart Pointer Type* that does
reference counting on its pointee:

* When created by its default constructor the pointer points to no object
  and creates an owner (reference) count set to zero.

* When created and initialized with a bare pointer it assumes it is the
  first and only one and creates an owner count set to 1.

* When initialized from another of its kind it points to the same object
  as the other (if any) and increments the - then shared - owner count.

* When assigned from another of its kind it first decrements the owner
  count and if it drops to zero, destroys the pointee, then continues as if
  it were initialized from the pointer assigned.

* When it goes out of scope it also decrements the owner count and if it
  drops to zero, destroys the pointee.

---
template: plain
name: shared_pointee_init
header: ### Shared Pointee Construction

Per default an `std::shared_ptr` is initialized with no pointee.

Given
```
class MyClass { … MyClass(bool, double, std::string); … };
```

an `std::shared_ptr` can be initialized to point to a heap allocated object of
type `MyClass` as follows:._[]
```
std::shared_ptr<MyClass> p1{new MyClass(true, 3.14, "hi!")};
```

Or:
```
auto p2 = std::make_shared<MyClass>(true, 3.14, "hi!");
```

.N[
The usual recommendation is to prefer the second way over the first as it can
reserve space for `MyClass` and the helper object (holding owner and observer
count) in a single heap allocation.
]

---
template: plain
name: shared_pointee_access
header: ### Shared Pointer Access

Given an `std::shared_ptr<SomeType> p` the most typical access to the pointee is via
overloaded `operator*` or `operator->`, possibly after a testing whether there is
an object:._[]
```
if (p) … *p …; // access whole object
       … p->m …; // access data member m
       … p->f(); // call member function f
```

Furthermore `p.get()` returns the address of the pointee (or `nullptr`), so

* it can bridge between `std::shared_ptr` and legacy code that expects a native
  pointer,

* at least as long as the recipient is short-lived (compared to `p`) and

* **does not assume ownership**.

---
template: plain
name: shared_pointee_destruct
header: ### Shared Pointee Destruction

The default way to destruct the pointee (when the owner count drops to zero) is
with `delete`.

If this is not appropriate a custom deleter can be specified at construction time:
```
std::shared_ptr<std::FILE> auto_close_fp{
    std::fopen("somefile", "r"),
    [](FILE *fp) { if (fp) std::fclose(fp); }
};
```

If the pointee is guaranteed to be valid or a custom deleter with a single pointer
argument of pointee-type that is `nullptr`-safe it could be specified directly:
```
if (auto fp = fopen("myfile", "w")) {
   std::shared_ptr<std::FILE> auto_close_fp{fp, std::fclose};
   …
}
```

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 5.2.2
name: cpp11_weak_ptr
header: ## C++11: `std::weak_ptr`

With `std::weak_ptr` C++ introduced a companion to `std::shared_ptr`, mainly
used to break cyclic references, which would otherwise defeat one of the main
motivations for using with smart pointers as a light-weight, high-efficiency
garbage collector.

* An `std::weak_ptr` acts as **observer** of a pointee **owned** by an
  `std::shared_ptr`.

* As such it shares an manages an observer count (similar to but different
  from the owner count).

* A non-zero observer count **will not keep the pointee alive** if the owner
  count drops to zero.

* Therefore an `std::weak_ptr` has no way to access the pointee directly via
  overloaded `operator*` or `operator->`.

* To gain access it has first to obtain an `std::shared_ptr` - which might fail
  but if successful will keep the pointee alive even if all other owners cease.

---
template: plain
name: shared_pointee_usage
header: ### Weak Pointee Usage

Per default an `std::weak_ptr` is initialized with no pointee.

Given `std::shared_ptr<MyClass> p` an `std::weak_ptr` can be initialized to
the pointee referred by `p` (if any) with:
```
std::weak_ptr<MyClass> wp{p};
```

To get access to the pointee an `std::shared_ptr` must be obtained and tested:
```
if (auto sp = wp.lock()) {
   // sp != nullptr
   // now owns the object wp had observed
   … *sp …;   // access whole object
   … sp.m …;  // access data member m
   … sp->f(); // call member function f
} // sp goes out of scope, if all other owners
  // are gone pointee will get destroyed here
```

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 5.2.5
name: cpp11_unique_ptr
header: ## C++11: `std::unique_ptr`

An `std::unique_ptr` is - as the name suggests - the sole owner of its pointee:

* Therefore there can always be only one for each pointee, i.e.

  * it is **not possible** to copy-construct or copy-assign an `std::unique_ptr`
    from another one of its kind (yields a compile time error), but

  * it **is possible** move-construct or move-assign an `std::unique_ptr` from
    another one of its kind.

* When an `std::unique_ptr` goes out of scope or is re-assigned it first destroys
  its pointee (if any).

.N[
The implementation of `std::unique_ptr` is very close to native pointers, i.e.
same memory footprint, and also for most operations same performance, except
those that need to care for destruction of a previous pointee.
]

---
template: plain
name: unique_pointee_init
header: ### Unique Pointee Construction

Per default an `std::unique_ptr` is initialized with no pointee.

Given any type `T` (a builtin type, a class from the standard library, or a
user defined class) an `std::unique_ptr` can be initialized to point

* to a **single heap allocated object of this type**._[]
```
std::unique_ptr<MyClass> ptr{new T};
```

* or to an **array of `N` heap allocated objects**:
```
std::unique_ptr<T[]> arr{new T[N]};
```

.I[
The appropriate deleter is set depending on the template instantiation argument
`T` or `T[]`.
]

.F[:
Constructor arguments may be supplied as usual but there is no `std::make_unique`
analogous to `std::make_shared` until C++14.
]

---
template: plain
name: unique_pointee_access
header: ### Unique Pointer Access

Given an `std::unique_ptr<SomeType> p` the most typical access to the pointee is via
overloaded `operator*`, `operator->`, or `operator[]` if the pointee is an array ,
ossibly after a testing whether there is an object:._[]
```
if (p) … *p …; // access whole object
       … p->m …; // access data member m
       … p->f(); // call member function f
       … p[i] …; // access i-th whole object (0-origin)
```

Furthermore

* `p.get()` returns the address of the pointee (or `nullptr`), so it can bridge
   between `std::unique_ptr` and legacy code that expects a native pointer with
   shorter life-time as `p`;

* `p.release()` is similar but relinquishes ownership of the pointee **which the
   recipient has to assume then**.

---
template: plain
name: unique_pointer_move
header: ### Moving Unique Pointers

As unique pointers can not be copied, the (deliberate) use as initial values
for constuctor arguments is not possible:
```
extern std::unique_ptr<MyClass> make_MyClass();
…
std::unique_ptr<MyClass> p1 = make_MyClass(); // OK (move c'tor)
std::unique_ptr<MyClass> p2(p1); // ERROR (no copy c'tor exists)
```

Instead the exsting pointer needs to be moved:
```
std::unique_ptr<MyClass> p3(std::move(p1)) // OK (p1 nullptr now!)
```

Same for assignment - move works, copy does not:
```
p1 = p3;             // ERROR (no copy assignment exists)
p1 = make_MyClass(); // OK (move assignment)
p1 = std::move(p3);  // OK (p3 nullptr now!)
```

---
template: plain
name: shared_pointee_destruct
header: ### Unique Pointee Destruction

Per default the pointee is destructed with `delete` or `delete[]` depending on the
way an `std::unique_ptr` has been created. Wrong pairing will not be detected at
compile time but cause undefined runtime behaviour.._[]

```
{ std::unique_ptr<T[]> ptr{new T};
  …
} // destructor does delete[] on pointee address
```

Or:
```
{ std::unique_ptr<T> arr{new[N] T};
  …
} // destructor does delete on pointee address
```
.W[
Pairing plain allocation with array deallocation or array allocation with plain
deallocation has undefined behavior.
]

.F[:
In the best case this will cause an immediate crash with a good error message. But
a crash may also occur much later with a misleading error message (if any)  and
therefore may be hard to relate to its original cause, or there may be a memory
leak, memory overwritten with bad values, whatever ...
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Josuttis: 5.2.7
name: deprecated_auto_ptr
header: ## Deprecated `std::auto_ptr`

Prior C++11 the only *Smart Pointer* was `std::auto_ptr`, which is now deprecated.

* It had nearly the same behavior (and implementation) as `std::unique_ptr` has now,
  but C++98 had no means to forbid the copying versions of constructor and assignment
  while still allowing the move versions.

* Therefore `std::auto_ptr` had copy-constructor and -assignment which set their
  right hand side to `NULL` (i.e. the auto-pointer used for initialisation or from
  which the pointee was assigned).

* That came to surprise many developers who had expected a "more intelligent"
  behaviour.

.N[
Or as Bjarne Stroustrup once put it: With C++11 `std::unique_ptr` became what
`std::auto_ptr` in C++98 always should have been but couldn't, due to lacking
proper language support.
]

template: refersto
see_also: Schäling: 2.3
name: boost_scoped_pointer
header: ## Boost: Smart Pointer

The term *Smart Pointer* is sometimes used to subsume pointer-like helper classes
which are in Boost:

* `boost::shared_ptr`:  
   much like `std::shared_ptr` (the latter mostly emerged from the former);

* `boost::weak_ptr`:  
   much like `std::weak_ptr` (the latter mostly emerged from the former);

* `boost::scoped_ptr` and `boost::scoped_array`:  
   close to `std::unique_ptr` but in two variants to provide different destructors
   to do a plain `delete` or a `delete[]` on the pointee.

* `boost::intrusive_ptr`:  
   similar in purpose to `boost::shared_ptr` / `std::shared_ptr` but storing the
   rerefence count inside the pointee (which such must be accessible).

---
template: refersto
see_also: Schäling: 2.3
name: boost_scoped_pointer
header: ## Boost: Scoped Pointer

A [Scoped Pointer] considers itself to be the sole owner of a

* **single object allocated on the heap**

and will finally destroy its pointee (if any) when going out of scope or a new
pointee is assigned.

* There is no copy-constructor and -assignment, the only way to re-assign a
  `boost::scoped_ptr` is via `swap` (available globally and as member function);

* Final destruction will use `delete`, therefore expecting the pointee is a single
  object.

.W[
If a `boost::scoped_ptr` is initialized with an address not returned from `new` or
pointing to an array of objects returned from obtained with array heap allocation,
undefined behaviour will result at runtime.
]

template: refersto
see_also: Schäling: 2.4
name: boost_scoped_array
header: ## Boost: Scoped Array

A [Scoped Array] considers itself to be the sole owner of

* **an array of objects allocated on the heap**

and will finally destroy its pointee (if any) when it goes out of scope or a new
pointee is assigned.

* There is no copy-constructor and -assignment, the only way to re-assign a
  `boost::scoped_array` is via `swap` (available globally and as member function);

* Final destruction will use `delete[]`, therefore expecting the pointee is an
  array of objects.

.W[
If a `boost::scoped_array` is initialized with an address not returned from `new` or
pointing to a single object returned from plain heap allocation, undefined behaviour
will result at runtime.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Schäling: 2.5
name: boost_intrusive_pointer
header: ## Boost: Intrusive Pointer

An [Intrusive Pointer] is much like a reference counted `boost::shared_ptr` or
`std::shared_ptr`.

* Instead of allocating reference counts separately it expects two global functions
  overladed for pointers to the pointee's type:

  * `intrusive_ptr_add_ref` - called when a new refererer for the pointee is added.

  * `intrusive_ptr_release` - called when an existing refererer of the pointee gets
     re-assigned or goes out of scope.

* Furthermore there is a class `boost::intrusive_ref_counter` from
  which the pointee's class may be derived.._[]

.N[
Boost recommends in case of doubt to prefer ordinary shared pointers and to avoid
using intrusive pointers without good reason.
]

[Intrusive Pointer]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/smart_ptr/intrusive_ptr.html

.F[:
Of course given its source is written from scratch or at least available and can be modified.
]

---
template: plain
name: intrusive_pointer_example
header: ### Intrusive Pointer Example

To make `MyClass` usable with intrusive pointers it can be written as:._[]
```
class MyClass : public boost::intrusive_ref_counter<MyClass,
                               boost::thread_unsafe_counter> {
    …
};
```

Or if it should be usable in a multi-threaded environment:
```
class MyClass : public boost::intrusive_ref_counter<MyClass,
                                 boost::thread_safe_counter> {
    …
};
```

Then there can be intrusive pointers of `MyClass`:
```
boost::intrusive_ptr<MyClass> p{new MyClass(…)};
```

.F[:
The second template argument may be omitted as defaults to `boost::thread_unsafe_counter`.
]

---
template: refersto
see_also: Schäling: 2.6
name: boost_pointer_container
header: ## Boost: Pointer Container

A number of [Pointer Containers] has been made available by boost, paralleling the
STL containers with a pointer version that

* omitts the pointer syntax at instantiation,

* add one level of dereferencing to each member access

* considers its elements as pointers owning the memory pointed to.

While the former two are more a matter of convenience (see example on next slide),
the last one has a severe semantical implication:

* If the container goes out of scope it deletes all the pointees of its (still)
  contained elements.._[]

.W[
Storing non-owning pointers or pointers that do not even point to heap-allocated
objects in a pointer container will cause undefined behaviour.
]

.F[:
This effect can alternatively be achieved by storing `std::unique_ptr`-s in an
ordinary container.
]

---
template: plain
name: pointer_container_example
header: ### Pointer Container Example

Storing and later on processing a `boost::ptr_vector`:
```
boost::ptr_vector<MyClass> v;
…
// fill in some content (probably in a loop):._[]
… v.push_back(new MyClass(…));

// process later (or maybe in a different thread):
while (!v.empty()) {
   … v.back() …; // access MyClass as a whole
   … v.back().m …; // access MyClass data member
   … v.back().f() …; // call MyClass member function
   v.pop_back();
}
```

.N[
In case the processing loop is not reached or left before the content is fully
processed, **the pointer container destructor** will call `delete` for the
pointers still contained, avoiding a memory leak.
]

.F[:
If a pointer container actually gets filled and processed concurrently as
suggested by the comment in the example, mutexes or other synchronization techniques
must be added as modifying operations are not thread-safe by themselves.
]

---
template: plain
name: pointer_container_substitute
header: ### Pointer Container Substitute

Storing and later on processing a container of custodial pointers:
```
std::vector<std::unique_ptr<MyClass>> v;
…
// fill in some content (probably in a loop):
… v.push_back(new MyClass(…));

// process later (or maybe in a different thread):
while (!v.empty()) {
   … *(v.back()) … // access MyClass as a whole
   … v.back()->m … // access MyClass data member
   … v.back()->f() … // call MyClass member function
   v.pop_back();
}
```

.N[
In case the processing loop is not reached or left before the content is fully
processed, **the `std::unique_ptr` destructors** will call `delete` for their
pointees, avoiding a memory leak.
]

.F[:

added as modifying operations are not thread-safe by themselves.
]

---
template: plain
name: garbage_collection
header: ## Garbage Collection

There is no garbage collection in C++ because of a specific difficulty:

* **An address once obtained from `new` may not be visible in
  any memory location capable of holding a heap address**, instead it

  1. may have been modified by address arithmetic ... which will of course be
     reverted before the `delete` takes place;

  2. may be temporarily stored in an integral type._[] ... and will of course be
     restored to a pointer of appropriate type before the `delete` takes place.

.N[
Both are not a sign of bad programming style but have some valid uses in the
C and C++ code base written in the last 35 years, so they cannot be easily
ruled-out by a new language standard.
]

.F[:
C/C++ even guarantees that when an integral type of sufficient size is used
as temporary to store a pointer, after assigning the content back to the
original pointer type the memory location pointed to will not have changed
... which by no means says that the bit patterns stays the same!
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_gc_interface
header: ### Garbage Collection API

C++11 has defined an API to enable *Interested Third Parties* to supply a
garbage collector as add-on library.._[]

Mainly the API allows to say (put colloquially):

* **The object at this address I name to you may appear not to be any longer
  in use.**

  * You may not find it in any memory location capable of holding a heap pointer.
    Nevertheless be assured: it *is* still in use, so *do not garbage collect it*,
    I'll take up responsibility and return the reserved space in due course when
    its *really* not in use any more.

* **In this memory area I name to you, you may find storage cells looking
  like pointers to heap memory, but they aren't.**

  * So, in case there is any memory pending to be freed and *its only use appears
    to be from inside this area*, feel free to go ahead and garbage collect that
    stuff.

.F[:
It will surely be interesting to watch such efforts and if any some third-party
garbage collector for C++ gets into wide-spread use. If so, then probably rather
for new software, not for large amounts of legacy code (including libraries), and
maybe only with additional support by compiler warnings.
