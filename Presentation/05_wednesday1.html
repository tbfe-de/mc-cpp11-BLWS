template: plain
name: cpp11_shared_ptr
header: ## C++11: `std::shared_ptr`

[`std::shared_ptr`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr
[Smart Pointer]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer

With [`std::shared_ptr`] C++11 introduced a [Smart Pointer] type that does
reference counting on its pointee:

* When created by its default constructor it points to no object and creates
  an owner (reference) count set to zero.

* When created and initialized with a bare pointer it assumes it is the first
  and only one and creates an owner count set to 1.

* When initialized from another of its kind it points to the same object as the
  other (if any) and increments the – then shared – owner count.

* When assigned from another of its kind it first decrements the owner count and
  if that drops to zero, destroys the pointee; then it continues as if it were
  initialized from the pointer assigned to it.

* When it goes out of scope it also decrements the owner count and if that drops
  to zero, destroys the pointee.

---
template: plain
name: shared_pointee_init
header: ### Shared Pointee Construction

Per default an `std::shared_ptr` is initialized with no pointee.

Given
```
class MyClass { … MyClass(bool, double, std::string); … };
```

an `std::shared_ptr` can be initialized to point to a heap allocated object of
type `MyClass` as follows:._[]
```
std::shared_ptr<MyClass> p1{new MyClass(true, 3.14, "hi!")};
```

Or:
```
auto p2 = std::make_shared<MyClass>(true, 3.14, "hi!");
```

The usual recommendation is to prefer the second way over the first as it can
reserve space for `MyClass` together with the helper object (holding owner and
observer count._[]) in a single heap allocation.

.F[:
The observer count has not yet been introduced; its purpose will become clear
when [`std::weak_ptr`](#cpp11_weak_ptr) gets explained.
]

---
template: plain
name: shared_pointee_access
header: ### Shared Pointee Access

Given an `std::shared_ptr<SomeType> p` the most typical access to the pointee is
via overloaded `operator*` or `operator->`, possibly after a testing whether
there is an object:._[]
```
if (p) … *p …; // access whole object
       … p->m …; // access data member m
       … p->f(); // call member function f
```

Furthermore `p.get()` returns the address of the pointee (or `nullptr`), so

* it can bridge between `std::shared_ptr` and legacy code that expects a native
  pointer,

* at least as long as the recipient is short-lived (compared to `p`) and

* **does not assume ownership**.

---
template: plain
name: shared_pointee_sharing
header: ### Shared Pointee Sharing

Sharing the pointee is the *raison d’être* of a an `std::share_ptr`. Therefore
it is clear that the following code
```
auto p1 = std::make_shared<T>( … ); // create T with c'tor arguments
…                          // ^^^--- as supplied here in parentheses
auto p2 = p1;       // OK
```

will create pointee which is then shared between `p1` and `p2` but with
```
auto p3 = p1.get()
```
`p3` assumes to be the sole owner of the object created as pointee for `p1`.

.W[
According to the standard this is *Undefined Behavior* which in practice will
typically lead dangling pointers …._[]
]

.F[:
… and depending on the whether and when the released memory is put into use
again to unpredictable aftereffects.
]

---
template: plain
name: shared_from_this
header: ### Shared From `this`

The same problem arises slightly disguised if an object already managed by a
shared pointer needs "to return itself":._[]
```
class MyClass {
    // ...
    MyClass* myself() { return this; }
};
```
.W[
If the address returned by `MyClass::myself` is used to initialize an
`std::shared_ptr<MySelf>` the problem is **exactly** the one discussed on the
previous page.
]

This is the
[recipe to follow](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/enable_shared_from_this):
```
class MyClass : public std::enable_shared_from_this {
    // ...
	std::shared_ptr<MyClass> myself() { return shared_from_this(); }
};
```

.F[:
A closeley related scenario is given when an object needs to register a member
function bound to itself as call-back to be invoked later.
]

---
template: plain
name: shared_pointee_destruct
header: ### Shared Pointee Destruction

The default way to destruct the pointee (when the owner count drops to zero) is
with `delete`.

If this is not appropriate a custom deleter can be specified at construction
time:
```
std::shared_ptr<std::FILE> auto_close_fp{
    std::fopen("somefile", "r"),
    [](FILE *fp) { if (fp) std::fclose(fp); }
};
```

If the pointee is guaranteed to be valid or a custom deleter with a single
pointer argument of pointee-type that is `nullptr`-safe._[] it could be
specified directly:
```
if (auto fp = fopen("myfile", "w")) {
   std::shared_ptr<std::FILE> auto_close_fp{fp, std::fclose};
   …
}
```

.F[:
Implementations of `fclose` differ in C, some are more robust and check the
pointer argument for `(FILE*)0`, but according to the C-Standard an invalid
pointer causes undefined behavior.
]

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_weak_ptr
header: ## C++11: `std::weak_ptr`

[`std::weak_ptr`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/weak_ptr

With [`std::weak_ptr`] C++ introduced a companion to `std::shared_ptr`, mainly
used to break cyclic references, which would otherwise defeat one of the main
motivations for using smart pointers as a light-weight, high-efficiency
garbage collector.

* An `std::weak_ptr` acts as **observer** of a pointee **owned** by an
  `std::shared_ptr`.

* As such it shares and manages an observer count (similar to but different from
  the owner count).

* A non-zero observer count **will not keep the pointee alive** if the owner
  count drops to zero.

* Therefore an `std::weak_ptr` has no way to access the pointee directly via
  overloaded `operator*` or `operator->`.

* To gain access it **first has to obtain an `std::shared_ptr`** – which might
  fail but if successful will keep the pointee alive even if all other owners
  cease to exist.

---
template: plain
name: shared_pointee_usage
header: ### Weak Pointee Usage

Per default an `std::weak_ptr` is initialized with no pointee.

Given `std::shared_ptr<MyClass> p` an `std::weak_ptr` can be initialized to the
pointee referred by `p` (if any) with:
```
std::weak_ptr<MyClass> wp{p};
```

To get access to the pointee an `std::shared_ptr` must be obtained and tested:
```
if (auto sp = wp.lock()) {
    // sp != nullptr
    // now owns the object wp had observed
    … *sp …;   // access whole object
    … sp.m …;  // access data member m
    … sp->f(); // call member function f
} // sp goes out of scope, if all other owners
  // are gone pointee will get destroyed here
```

---
template: plain
name: cpp11_unique_ptr
header: ## C++11: `std::unique_ptr`

[`std::unique_ptr`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr

An [`std::unique_ptr`] is – as the name suggests – the sole owner of its
pointee:

* Therefore there can always be only one for each pointee, i.e.

  * it is **not possible** to copy-construct or copy-assign an `std::unique_ptr`
    from another one of its kind (yields a compile time error), but

  * it **is possible** to move-construct or move-assign an `std::unique_ptr`
    from another one of its kind.

* When an `std::unique_ptr` goes out of scope or is re-assigned it first
  destroys its pointee (if any).

.N[
The implementation of `std::unique_ptr` is very close to native pointers, i.e.
same memory footprint, and also for most operations same performance, except
those that need to care for destruction of a (previous) pointee.
]

---
template: plain
name: unique_pointee_init
header: ### Unique Pointee Construction

Per default an `std::unique_ptr` is initialized with no pointee.

Given any type `T` (a built-in type, a class from the standard library, or a user
defined class) an `std::unique_ptr` can be initialized to point

* to a **single heap allocated object of this type**._[]
```
std::unique_ptr<T> ptr{new T};
```

* or to an **array of `N` heap allocated objects**:
```
std::unique_ptr<T[]> arr{new T[N]};
```

.I[
The appropriate deleter is set depending on the template instantiation argument
`T` or `T[]`.
]

.F[:
Constructor arguments may be supplied as usual but there is no
`std::make_unique` analogous to `std::make_shared` until C++14.
]

---
template: plain
name: unique_pointee_access
header: ### Unique Pointee Access

Given an `std::unique_ptr<SomeType> p` the most typical access to the pointee is
via overloaded `operator*`, `operator->`, or `operator[]` if the pointee is an
array, possibly after a testing whether there is an object:._[]
```
if (p) … *p …; // access whole object
       … p->m …; // access data member m
       … p->f(); // call member function f
       … p[i] …; // access i-th whole object (0-origin)
```

Furthermore

* `p.get()` returns the address of the pointee (or `nullptr`), so it can bridge
   between `std::unique_ptr` and legacy code that expects a native pointer with
   shorter lifetime as `p`;

* `p.release()` is similar but relinquishes ownership of the pointee **which the
   recipient has to assume then**.

---
template: plain
name: unique_pointer_move
header: ### Moving Unique Pointers

As unique pointers can not be copied, the (deliberate) use as initial values for
copy constructor arguments is not possible:
```
extern std::unique_ptr<MyClass> make_MyClass();
…
std::unique_ptr<MyClass> p1 = make_MyClass(); // OK (move c'tor)
std::unique_ptr<MyClass> p2(p1); // ERROR (no copy c'tor exists)
```

Instead the exsting pointer needs to be moved:
```
std::unique_ptr<MyClass> p3(std::move(p1)) // OK (p1 nullptr now!)
```

Same for assignment – move works, copy does not:
```
p1 = p3;             // ERROR (no copy assignment exists)
p1 = make_MyClass(); // OK (move assignment)
p1 = std::move(p3);  // OK (p3 nullptr now!)
```

---
template: plain
name: shared_pointee_destruct
header: ### Unique Pointee Destruction

Per default the pointee is destructed with `delete` or `delete[]` depending on
the way an `std::unique_ptr` has been created. Wrong pairing will not be
detected at compile time but cause undefined runtime behaviour.._[]
```
{ std::unique_ptr<T[]> ptr{new T};
  …
} // destructor does delete[] on pointee address
```

Or:
```
{ std::unique_ptr<T> arr{new[N] T};
  …
} // destructor does delete on pointee address
```
.W[
Pairing plain allocation with array deallocation or array allocation with plain
deallocation has undefined behavior.
]

.F[:
In the best case this will cause an immediate crash with a good error message.
But a crash may also occur much later with a misleading error message (if any)
and therefore may be hard to relate to its original cause, or there may be a
memory leak, memory overwritten with bad values, whatever …

template: plain
name: deprecated_auto_ptr
header: ## Deprecated `std::auto_ptr`

[`std::auto_ptr`]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/auto_ptr
[Smart Pointer]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer

The only [Smart Pointer] in C++98 was [`std::auto_ptr`], which is deprecated
since C++11.

* It had nearly the same behavior (and implementation) as `std::unique_ptr` has
  now, but C++98 had no means to forbid the copying versions of constructor and
  assignment while still allowing the move versions.

* Therefore `std::auto_ptr` had "copy"-constructor and -assignment which set
  their right hand side to `NULL`, i.e. the auto-pointer used for
  initialisation or from which the pointee was assigned lost its pointee.

* **That came as a surprise to some developers expecting a "more intelligent"
  behaviour from a "smart pointer".**

.N[
Or as Bjarne Stroustrup once put it: With C++11 `std::unique_ptr` became what
`std::auto_ptr` in C++98 always should have been but couldn't, due to lacking
proper language support.
]

template: plain
name: boost_smart_pointer
header: ## Boost: Smart Pointer

[Smart Pointer]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer

The term *Smart Pointer* is also used to subsume pointer-like helper classes
in Boost:

* `boost::shared_ptr`:  
   much like `std::shared_ptr` (the latter mostly emerged from the former);

* `boost::weak_ptr`:  
   much like `std::weak_ptr` (the latter mostly emerged from the former);

* `boost::scoped_ptr` and `boost::scoped_array`:  
   close to `std::unique_ptr` but in two variants to provide different
   destructors to do a plain `delete` or a `delete[]` on the pointee.

* `boost::intrusive_ptr`:  
   similar in purpose to `boost::shared_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` but storing
   the rerefence count inside the pointee (which therefore must be accessible).

---
template: plain
name: boost_scoped_pointer
header: ## Boost: Scoped Pointer

[Scoped Pointer]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/smart_ptr/scoped_ptr.htm

A [Scoped Pointer] considers itself to be the sole owner of a

* **single object allocated on the heap**

and will finally destroy its pointee (if any) when going out of scope or a new
pointee is assigned.

* There is no copy-constructor and -assignment, the only way to re-assign a
  `boost::scoped_ptr` is via `swap` (available globally and as member function);

* Final destruction will use `delete`, therefore expecting the pointee is a
  single object.

.W[
If a `boost::scoped_ptr` is initialized with an address not returned from `new`
or is pointing to an array of objects returned from array heap allocation,
undefined behaviour will result at deletion time.
]

---
template: plain
name: boost_scoped_array
header: ## Boost: Scoped Array

[Scoped Array]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/smart_ptr/scoped_array.htm

A [Scoped Array] considers itself to be the sole owner of

* **an array of objects allocated on the heap**

and will finally destroy its pointee (if any) when it goes out of scope or a new
pointee is assigned.

* There is no copy-constructor and -assignment, the only way to re-assign a
  `boost::scoped_array` is via `swap` (available globally and as member
  function);

* Final destruction will use `delete[]`, therefore expecting the pointee is an
  array of objects.

.W[
If a `boost::scoped_array` is initialized with an address not returned from
`new` or pointing to a single object returned from plain heap allocation,
undefined behaviour will result at deletion time.
]

---
template: plain
name: boost_intrusive_pointer
header: ## Boost: Intrusive Pointer

[Intrusive Pointer]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/smart_ptr/intrusive_ptr.html

An [Intrusive Pointer] is much like a reference counted `boost::shared_ptr` or
`std::shared_ptr`.

* Instead of allocating reference counts separately it expects two global
  functions overladed for pointers to the pointee's type:

  * `intrusive_ptr_add_ref` – called when a new referrer for the pointee is
    added.

  * `intrusive_ptr_release` – called when an existing referrer of the pointee
    gets re-assigned or goes out of scope.

* Furthermore there is a class `boost::intrusive_ref_counter` from which the
  pointee's class may be derived.._[]

.N[
Boost recommends in case of doubt to prefer ordinary shared pointers and to
avoid using intrusive pointers without good reason.
]

.F[:
Of course given its source is written from scratch or at least available and can
be modified.
]

---
template: plain
name: intrusive_pointer_example
header: ### Intrusive Pointer Example

To make `MyClass` usable with intrusive pointers it can be written as:._[]
```
class MyClass :
    public boost::intrusive_ref_counter<
                      MyClass,
                      boost::thread_unsafe_counter
           > { … };
```

Or if it should be usable in a multi-threaded environment:
```
class MyClass :
    public boost::intrusive_ref_counter<
                      MyClass,
                      boost::thread_safe_counter
           > { … };
```

Then there can be intrusive pointers of `MyClass`:
```
boost::intrusive_ptr<MyClass> p{new MyClass(…)};
```

.F[:
The second template argument may be omitted as it defaults to
`boost::thread_unsafe_counter`.
]

---
template: plain
name: boost_pointer_container
header: ## Boost: Pointer Container

[Pointer Containers]: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/ptr_container/doc/ptr_container.html

A number of [Pointer Containers] has been made available by boost, paralleling
the STL containers with a pointer version that

* omits the pointer syntax at instantiation,

* adds one level of dereferencing to each member access, and

* considers its elements as pointers owning the memory pointed to.

While the former two are more a matter of convenience (see example on next
slide), the last one has a severe semantical implication:

* If the container goes out of scope it deletes all the pointees of its (still)
  contained elements.._[]

.F[:
This effect can alternatively be achieved by storing `std::unique_ptr`-s in an
ordinary container.
]

.W[
Storing non-owning pointers or pointers that do not even point to
heap-allocated memory in a pointer container will cause undefined behaviour
when the container goes out of scope.
]

---
template: plain
name: pointer_container_example
header: ### Pointer Container Example

Storing and later on processing a `boost::ptr_vector`:._[]
```
boost::ptr_vector<MyClass> v;
…
// fill in some content (probably in a loop):
… v.push_back(new MyClass(…));

// process later (or maybe in a different thread):
while (!v.empty()) {
   … v.back() …; // access MyClass as a whole
   … v.back().m …; // access MyClass data member
   … v.back().f(); // call MyClass member function
   v.pop_back();
}
```

.N[
In case the processing loop is not reached or left before the content is fully
processed, **the pointer container destructor** will call `delete` for the
pointers still contained, avoiding a memory leak.
]

.F[:
If a pointer container actually gets filled and processed concurrently as
suggested by the comment in the example, mutexes or other synchronization
techniques must be added as modifying operations are not thread-safe by
themselves.
]

---
template: plain
name: pointer_container_substitute
header: ### Pointer Container Substitute

Storing and later on processing a container of custodial pointers:._[]
```
std::vector<std::unique_ptr<MyClass>> v;
…
// fill in some content (probably in a loop):
… v.emplace_back(new MyClass(…));

// process later (or maybe in a different thread):
while (!v.empty()) {
   … *(v.back()) … // access MyClass as a whole
   … v.back()->m … // access MyClass data member
   … v.back()->f() … // call MyClass member function
   v.pop_back();
}
```

.F[:

]

.N[
In case the processing loop is not reached or left before the content is fully
processed, **the `std::unique_ptr` destructors** will call `delete` for their
pointees, avoiding a memory leak.
]

---
template: plain
name: garbage_collection
header: ## Garbage Collection

There is no garbage collection in C++ because of a specific difficulty:

* **An address once obtained from `new` may not be visible in any memory
  location capable of holding a heap address**, instead it

  1. may have been modified by address arithmetic … which will of course be
     reverted before the `delete` takes place;

  2. may be temporarily stored in an integral type._[] … and will of course be
     restored to a pointer of appropriate type before the `delete` takes place.

.N[
Both are not a sign of bad programming style but have some valid uses in the C
and C++ code base written in the last 35 years, so they cannot be easily ruled
out by a new language standard.
]

.F[:
C/C++ even guarantees that when an integral type of sufficient size is used as
temporary to store a pointer, after assigning the content back to the original
pointer type the memory location pointed to will not have changed … which by
no means says that the bit patterns stays the same all the time!

template: plain
name: cpp11_gc_interface
header: ### C++11: Garbage Collection API

[Garbage Collection ABI]: https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/cpp11-library#gc-abi
C++11 has defined an [Garbage Collection ABI] to enable *Interested Third
Parties* to supply garbage collection as add-on library.._[]

Mainly the ABI allows to say (put colloquially):

* **The object at this address I name to you may appear not to be any longer in
  use.**

  * You may not find it in any memory location capable of holding a heap
    pointer. Nevertheless be assured: it *is* still in use, so *do not garbage
    collect it*, I'll take up responsibility and return the reserved space in
    due course when its *really* not in use any more.

* **In this memory area I name to you, you may find storage cells looking like
  pointers to heap memory, but they aren't.**

  * So, in case there is any memory pending to be freed and *its only use
    appears to be from inside this area*, feel free to go ahead and garbage
    collect that stuff.

It will surely be interesting to watch such efforts and whether any third-party
garbage collector for C++ gets into wide-spread use. If so, then probably rather
for new software, not for large amounts of legacy code (including libraries),
and maybe only with additional support by compiler warnings.
